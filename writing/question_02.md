# Question 2

_Sound in interactive media traditionally plays a complementary role, augmenting, complementing, or clarifying visual and tactile interactions. Discuss: 1) how breaking this synchronicity—resulting in what Schafer calls schizophonia—can pave the way for sound autonomy, 2) how this autonomy can come to define sound-centric interactions and narratives, and 3) what challenges this poses to information transmission within the action-reaction loop.

## INTRO

Interaction Design is one of the more extensive design disciplines, and there a great number of elements involved. We can focus on a given design's relationship/use of space, time, texture, appearance, etc, but one of the core (and yet often overlooked) aspect of all interactions is sound. Even the most vision-forward or seemingly tactile-focused design includes a sonic element. Take the keyboard that I am currently using to type these words. The color, shape, and font usage on the keys have clearly been thought out. The feel as I press each key is kept fluid so as to minimize finger strain. But there has been serious attention paid to the way it sounds as well. The clicking sound as I type is not too loud as to disturb my neighbors in a coffee shop, but is giving me aural feedback to let me know that I have successfully entered the correct character. 

This attention to sound is important in interaction and user-experience design, and much has been written about how to make it the most successful. Traditionally, much of this study has been born out of sound studies in other design disciplines, including music and sonic broadcast media, narrative screen-based media, and interactive games. Looking at these various fields helps designers learn a great deal about how sound can support the goals of a given interaction, while also pointing the way for new opportunities once we subvert and break this support-centered correlation.

In film and other screen-based media, sound designers think about sounds as being either diegetic (happening in the world represented by the visuals) or nondiegetic (those sounds outside of the world such as voiceovers and soundtrack). Sound designer David Sonnenschein explains that often these nondiegetic sound "functions as an interpretive element, guiding the listener towards a certain feeling, subjectively beyond the visual elements." Film was the first of the twentieth century media to recognize the importance of sound, with the credit of "sound designer" becoming common in the 1970s. 

In the world of sound design for games, Karen Collins breaks these categories down further into nondynamic sounds (which hew more traditionally to the diegetic/nondiegetic divide) and dynamic sounds which are triggered by game state, game environment, or player interaction. Collins separates these dynamic sounds further into their interactive and adaptive qualities, but the main aspect is how these sounds increase the strength of the player-system relationship. In fact, Brenda Laurel claims that the "\[t]ight linkage between visual, kinesthetic, and auditory modalities is the key to the sense of immersion that is created by many computer games, simulations, and virtual-reality systems."

This "tight linkage" is seen in other non-play-based interactive applications as well. EXAMPLES

However, many practitioners and scholars lament the backseat nature of sound in the design of an overall experience. EXAMPLES For Film, Rick Altman discusses what he refers to as "the ontological fallacy" as one of his "Four and a Half Film Fallacies" where film critics have argued that "image without sound still constitutes cinema, while sound without an image is no longer cinema." Altman claims that these arguments are purposefully made to negate the influence of sound on film. Similarly, sound designer Rob Bridgett complains of sound-focused (and often even sound-led) game production teams, "falling back on the old scheduling methodologies that prevent sound from being in a true leadership role." Karen Collins also agrees that

What happens then, when sound does not play a secondary role to the interactive and/or visual goals, and instead functions in a separate and equally important context?

In his *Treatise on Musical Objects,* french composer and electrical engineer Pierre Schaeffer introduces the concept of "acousmatics." For Schaeffer, recorded media fundamentally divorces sounds from its source and creates an entirely new listening experience. Acousmatics builds on Edmund Husserl's concept of phenomenology in that listeners are no longer listening to "a piano," but rather a "sonorous object" that includes the acoustic signal, playback method, playback location reverberation, and listener perception. Additionally, the acousmatic no longer relies on the visual for context. In acousmatic listening, "we listen to the sonorous forms, without any aim other than of hearing them better, in order to be able to describe them through an analysis of our perceptions."

Schaeffer's own *musique concrete* is an example of the acousmatic in practice. By divorcing the sound of a train from the experience of standing in a train-yard in _Étude aux chemins de fer_, Schaeffer is able to present the listener with an entirely new sensation. Further, by manipulating these sounds through chopping, looping and electronically processing, *musique concrete* brings to the acoustic space sounds that did not exist before.

In *The New Soundscape*, R. Murray Schafer presents his own version of this idea as "schizophonia," which he deliberately names in relation to schizophrenia to indicate "the same sense of aberration and drama." Revisiting the topic in *The Tuning of the World (The Soundscape)* he floridly explains:

_Sounds have ben torn from their natural sockets and given amplified and independent existence. Vocal sound, for instance, is no longer tied to a hole in the head but it is free to issue from anywhere in the landscape. In the same instant it may issue from millions of holes in millions of public and private places around the world _

Where Schaeffer sees potential and possibility, Schafer senses danger. Jonathan Sterne, in his introduction to the section on recorded media in *The Sound Studies Reader*, likens this distrust to Plato's *The Phaedrus* where Socrates prefers living speech over dead paintings because "they go on telling you just one thing forever." BENJAMIN. 

Footnote - Jason Stanyek and Benjamin Piekut propose the term "rhizophonia" as a replacement arguing that schizophonia seeks to describe an exception (sound as separate from source) when in reality "all sound are severed from their sources--that's what makes sound sound."


## SOUND AS SOMETHING ELSE

When we begin to think of sound apart from a supporting role, new possibilities open up to us.

### Sound Autonomy

As Berndt states in his paper from the Ambient@40 conference in 2018:

_It is now possible to use any data stream to modulate one or more parameters automatically. This could be, for instance, the distance between player position and level exit, the number of non-player characters in the scene, the complexity of a puzzle, health meter, mouse cursor movement, or sensor data (e.g. light, accelerometer, microphone). Music now functions as a sonification of this input data, a Musical Auditory Display. [...] Such a Musical Auditory Display establishes a much closer relation to player interaction and the game’s diegesis. It can help to create an even more personalized player experience._
