# PB Feedback from the Presentation on 11.14

Hey-o

Finally getting to this. I though the presentation on Thursday was **very** good (good-looking too). It felt like this was really spinning up into something coherent and "proposable" with the proviso of finding that kind of nuclear bit that will set everything straight. Easier said than done of course. Maybe we grab a more extended coffee some time soon to see if we can root it out?

Meanwhile, I'm attaching my literal notes here below ← you'll be able to see how interested I was from all the fires!

There are some really juicy things to grab onto I think. I half-wonder whether the tension/oscillation/"confusion" around reflection/contemplation/attention/ambience could be a focus rather than a problem.

**Experimental Sound Design for Reflective Video Games**

**Matthew Bethancourt**

**Presentation**

- What is the right word? "Slow" "Contemplative" "Reflective"
    

- 🔥 Are there serious theoretical/example implications for this
    

- The synth project
    

- Using a synth that is also something else, tuning in and ending up in a more experitial (Panoramical) bit
    
- 🔥 In relationship to Panoramical?
    

- Feels like a throw-back to earlier game design work
    

- The "leave it alone" as a technique 🔥 (Screen savers, my advice to Waylon, ...)
    
- The question of: hiding things (the anxiety of whether they'll find it? 🔥)
    
- Phone yoga, holding the poses (🔥 That dancing game... Bounden)
    
- Rocking chair, if you rock over time things will happen (🔥 Makes me think about That Dragon Cancer)
    

- 🔥 Do you _make_ people contemplate, or do you reward them for doing so? Is/can contemplation (be) active?
    
- Goals
    

- How to get engagement with something "difficult" for serious time
    
- Create complex and lengthy musical interactions, playable album
    
- (🔥 Albums)
    

- Soundwalks
    

- Westerkamp
    

- Attention to the natural acoustics, telling something: pay attention, "tuning" 🔥 Role of directness?
    

- Cardiff/Miller
    

- An experience in a specific space directed by sound 🔥 Connections to reflection?
    

- Soundwalk experiments
    

- The RDR2
    

- The nature of doing this in video specifically as a way to catch people, to have them undistracted, they're _here to pay attention_, ...
    

- Washington Square
    

- That idea of _mixing_ between multiple realities (narrator, the recorded space, the space, ...)
    

- Slow Games+Audio
    

- Luke Jaaniste, approaching the ambient, "ambient mode"
    
- ABZÜ vs. Rilla in terms of a reflective experience
    

- Reflection → 🔥 Refraction? (Reflection and Immersion?)
    

- Lorelai and the Laser Eyes
    

- Good design documentation on their site; design values
    
- "Puzzles as the wrong kind of reflection" ← Anthropy game, broken puzzles as contemplative 🔥
    

- v r 5
    

- The buildings as a form of emphasis
    
- Walking versus running (I didn't disable it) 🔥
    
- v r 5 as a slideshow?
    
- The map as a breaking of the idea?
    
- Remapping v r 5? Wrong map? Untitled Goose Game style to-do lists that imply possibilities rather than show you where to go
    
- Georges brings up Skyrim and walking versus fast travel; that idea of pacing and tempo and contrasts... horror games? RDR2 travel and _looking around_ 🔥
    
- What would v r 5 have been like with more sound design?
    

- Slow Experiments
    

- 01 02, _ownership_ of sound → inclination to listen and contemplate? What have _I_ done? 🔥
    

- Experimental ideas across genres
    

- Performative objects
    

- "Difficult but not unfriendly"
    

- Contemplative architecture
    

- Salk; guiding the eye? 🔥  (The idea of guidance and the safety not to pay focused attention to something in the environment?)
    
- Contemplation involving "intense concentration" ← this question of intensity of experience, effortfulness, ...?
    

- Vilém Flusser
    
- Benjamin
    

- Experiments (text and audio)
    
- Goals
    

- A soulslike for contemplative game? Waiting is _hard_? The question of _audience_
    
- Antagonism?
    
- Materiality of games and "something deeper"?
    
- (How can you interact with something ...)
    

- 🔥 Reflection/contemplation _on what_?
    
- 🔥 Can you detach reflection/contemplation from an object?
    

- Can you be contemplating the nature of the interaction itself? (And what is that about? And what are existing games like that? Ginger, ...)
    

- Versus "attention", a mode/openness... with no object?
    
- 🔥 As a frame for a reflection people want to explore?
