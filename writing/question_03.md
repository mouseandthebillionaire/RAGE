# Question 3

_What are the current and historical approaches to the use of sound in the context of contemplation, with a particular focus on games? Please outline your process and results with respect to research-recreation responses to this subject area._

## Background
- LTHC
- The Meeting
- Digital Yoga
- Pando

## Initial Goals
- What do we call this? Slow? Reflective? Contemplative?
- How can we get players/users to engage with something confusing/abstract/"difficult" for a decent length of time?
- How can we create more complex ad lengthly musical interactions (playable album)
- How can we initiate contemplate/reflective experiences

## Precedents

### Soundwalks

### Slow Games

### Experimental Ideas

## Reflections / New Goals

### Thought/Idea - Foundational Elements of Games as Lenses for Reflection

Is it possible for us to think about the foundational elements of certain objects as the gateways from which a reflective/contemplative experience might stem? For example, is the contemplative nature of architecture embedded in the way that light hits certain colors? Or how light and sound reverberate together in a particular room? With a particular shape? And of a particular material? If this is the case, what are the material elements of other media that can be examples of contemplative art? Light and hue for painting. Timbre, frequency, and reverberation for audio. 

Taking this to the next logical step, is it better for us as designers to engage with the materiality of games, the things that make games games, rather than mimicking those aspects of contemplative experiences that we can only recreate digitally? Specifically, I think of the digital recreation of light or the physical world. And this is not to say that the light emminating from a screen isn't worthy of reflection. It is mainly that we seem to treat as one to one to other types of light. It is interesting to note that rather than approach the inherently thingy-ness of digital technology, we continue to rely on metaphors and ideas borrowed from existing areas of life. What are the things of digital technology or of games (the stuff games are made of) that we can build these contemplative experiences out of.

As a rudimentary step, we can look at Fullerton's formal elements of games. How could these be addressed as potential lenses for which we might design contemplatively? And how could we learn from existing domains that might have potential crossover or lessons to apply to these?
