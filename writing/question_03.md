## Contemplation Aesthetics

Book III of Schopenhauer's "The World as Will and Representation" holds some interesting language about what he calls "aesthetic contemplation," which I feel may be pertinent to the ideas that I seek to explore. In section 34 he describes the shift from looking at something through "reason" to "a steady contemplation" by saying:

_if, instead of all this, we devote the entire power of our mind to intuition and immerse ourselves in this entirely, letting the whole of consciousness be filled with peaceful contemplation of the natural object that is directly present, a landscape, a tree, a cliff, a building, or whatever it might be, and, according to a suggestive figure of speech, we *lose* ourselves in this object completely, i.e we forget our individuality, our will, and continue to exist only as pure subject, the clear mirror of the object_

Schopenhauer argues that this shift helps to being the viewer closer to the "Idea" rather than the object, echoing Plato's notion of an ideal form. While we don't necessarily need to carry over this idea of an idealized form (or spiritual/essential perfection) this concept of aesthetic contemplation is helpful in discussing the type of experience that one could have with the built world, an experience that moves from the surface to something deeper. What is especially helpful is the way that Schopenhauer includes space for *active* contemplation on the part of the viewer. It is not a passive, peaceful, zen calm, but rather an attitude of looking that is searching for more. Some philosophers and art historians have coined the term ["aesthetic attitude"](https://iep.utm.edu/aesthetic-attitude/) to explain this idea. 

Is it possible, then, for us to think about the foundational elements of certain objects as the gateways from which a reflective/contemplative experience might stem? For example, is the contemplative nature of architecture embedded in the way that light hits certain colors? Or how light and sound reverberate together in a particular room? With a particular shape? And of a particular material? If this is the case, what are the material elements of other media that can be examples of contemplative art? Light and hue for painting. Timbre, frequency, and reverberation for audio. 

Aesthetic attitude / Aesthetics of digital interactive art

Taking this to the next logical step, is it better for us as designers to engage with the materiality of games, the things that make games games, rather than mimicking those aspects of contemplative experiences that we can only recreate digitally? Specifically, I think of the digital recreation of light or the physical world. And this is not to say that the light emminating from a screen isn't worthy of reflection. It is mainly that we seem to treat as one to one to other types of light. It is interesting to note that rather than approach the inherently thingy-ness of digital technology, we continue to rely on metaphors and ideas borrowed from existing areas of life. What are the things of digital technology or of games (the stuff games are made of) that we can build these contemplative experiences out of.

As a rudimentary step, we can look at Fullerton's formal elements of games. How could these be addressed as potential lenses for which we might design contemplatively? And how could we learn from existing domains that might have potential crossover or lessons to apply to these?

## Elements, Precedents, and Experiments
- Magic Circle / Soundwalks
- Time / Slow Games
- Space & Movement / Aesthetic Architecture
- Rules?
- Agency?

Side note: I am realizing that all of these could possibly be framed with Soundwalks as the connecting tissue, in which case the format might be more of:
- element A is in games
- here is how that is handled in Soundwalks
- here is how it is handled in other disciplines
- here is a series of experiments I made in reaction to this
