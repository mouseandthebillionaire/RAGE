## Contemplation Aesthetics

Book III of Schopenhauer's "The World as Will and Representation" holds some interesting language about what he calls "aesthetic contemplation," which I feel may be pertinent to the ideas that I seek to explore. In section 34 he describes the shift from looking at something through "reason" to "a steady contemplation" by saying:

_if, instead of all this, we devote the entire power of our mind to intuition and immerse ourselves in this entirely, letting the whole of consciousness be filled with peaceful contemplation of the natural object that is directly present, a landscape, a tree, a cliff, a building, or whatever it might be, and, according to a suggestive figure of speech, we *lose* ourselves in this object completely, i.e we forget our individuality, our will, and continue to exist only as pure subject, the clear mirror of the object_

Schopenhauer argues that this shift helps to being the viewer closer to the "Idea" rather than the object, echoing Plato's notion of an ideal form. While we don't necessarily need to carry over this idea of an idealized form (or spiritual/essential perfection) this concept of aesthetic contemplation is helpful in discussing the type of experience that one could have with the built world, an experience that moves from the surface to something deeper. What is especially helpful is the way that Schopenhauer includes space for *active* contemplation on the part of the viewer. It is not a passive, peaceful, zen calm, but rather an attitude of looking that is searching for more. Some philosophers and art historians have coined the term ["aesthetic attitude"](https://iep.utm.edu/aesthetic-attitude/) to explain this idea. 

Is it possible, then, for us to think about the foundational elements of certain objects as the gateways from which a reflective/contemplative experience might stem? For example, is the contemplative nature of architecture embedded in the way that light hits certain colors? Or how light and sound reverberate together in a particular room? With a particular shape? And of a particular material? If this is the case, what are the material elements of other media that can be examples of contemplative art? Light and hue for painting. Timbre, frequency, and reverberation for audio. 

Aesthetic attitude / Aesthetics of digital interactive art

Taking this to the next logical step, is it better for us as designers to engage with the materiality of games, the things that make games games, rather than mimicking those aspects of contemplative experiences that we can only recreate digitally? Specifically, I think of the digital recreation of light or the physical world. And this is not to say that the light emanating from a screen isn't worthy of reflection. It is mainly that we seem to treat as one to one to other types of light. It is interesting to note that rather than approach the inherently thingy-ness of digital technology, we continue to rely on metaphors and ideas borrowed from existing areas of life. What are the things of digital technology or of games (the stuff games are made of) that we can build these contemplative experiences out of.

As an exploration, below are three possible aesthetic materials of games that can be used for lenses/methods/areas of contemplative engagement. Though I am looking at these aspects from the specific point of view of games, much can be learned by how these materials are considered by practitioners in other contemplative artforms. All of is then applied to the designing of exploratory experiments to see how a contemplative state in games could be designed for.

## Aesthetics for Contemplative Audio Games

### Soundwalks

#### Westerkamp

One field of practice that can greatly inform this concept of contemplative games is Soundwalking. Soundwalking started as part of R. Murray Schafer's *World Soundscape Project*, which arose out of active listening practices being developed by artists like John Cage and Pauline Oliveras. Schafer and those in the project sought to anchor these active listening practices to a given place. Hildegard Westerkamp especially believed that through soundwalking, listeners could better understand their sonic environments. 

_A soundwalk is any excursion whose main purpose is listening to the environment. It is exposing our ears to every sound around us no matter where we are. We may be at home, we may be walking across a downtown street, through a park, along the beach; we may be sitting in a doctor's office, in a hotel lobby, in a bank; we may be shopping in a supermarket, a department store, or a Chinese grocery store; we may be standing at the airport, the train station, the bus-stop. Wherever we go we will give our ears priority. They have been neglected by us for a long time and, as a result, we have done little to develop an acoustic environment of good quality._[^2]

Additionally, Westerkamp recorded soundwalks so that those who could not actually visit a given location could experience it remotely. Westerkamp then broadcasted these recordings on her radio program on Vancouver Co-op Radio, sometimes commenting o what the listener was hearing. These guided soundwalks were a way to point out to the listener things that they otherwise might have missed.

#### Experiments S.1 & S.2

In response to this Westerkampian style of Soundwalk, I created a series of recorded audio essays over videogame footage. In these experiments, I pointed out sonic elements from the game, directing the listener's attention to how these worked in the game and maybe giving technological background for how these sounds might function on a sound design level. 

_What does it even mean to listen to our games? There is sound there, to be sure, but do we pay attention to it? What do you hear right now as you play? What time of day is it, and how are the sounds communicating that to you? Are you in a bustling part of the financial district at mid-morning with citizens congratulating you on your most recent exploits? Are you in a more isolated part of the city in the late evening? Maybe Central Park with small scurrying animals and the wind whistling through the trees._[^3]

One revelation from this process is realizing how the material edges blur when we are talking about "soundwalking" in games. In the physical world we are pointing to real sonic phenomena out in the world, whether that is from natural or manmade sources (the way the wind whistles through a tree's leaves, the sound that a bridge makes when you rap it with your fists). But in games, we are expounding upon the sonic qualities of digitally replicated sounds, sounds which have been designed a certain way and added to the space for a given reason. In this way, we can argue that one of the underlying "natural" aspects of this sonic environment is its technology. Thinking about this technology (and the associated design, social, and economic systems around it) as a material aspect of the soundscape opens up some interesting possibilities for future consideration.
#### Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller

The Soundwalks of Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller differ from Westerkamp's in a few ways. While are similar to Westerkamps in-person guided listening walks in that they take place in a given sonic environment that the listener is currently in, neither Cardiff or Miller are actually present. Instead, the listener is guided by Cardiff's pre-recorded voice via headphones. Cardiff/Miller leverage this recorded to technology to then overlay audio in exploratory and exciting ways. Snippets of conversation slip by that feel like that are in the same space as you. Cardiff speaks directly to you, but then has conversation with others who are not visibly present. Recorded audio effects of things like long gone marching bands, sirens, and political rallies make the listener feel as if they are experiencing a highly professional radio drama. 

From Cardiff/Miller, I identified six strategies for creating deep experiences with soundwalks.

- *Synchronization* - Creating a sense of rhythm and focus by asking the participant to align physical actions to the audio (breathing, walking, looking)
- *Frame-Shifting* - Indirectly encouraging active listening by juxtaposing and overlaying incongruous and/or complex sounds
- *Parallel Realities* - Layering 3D sounds and effects that blur the listener’s perception of recorded and live space
- *Alternative Scoring* - Overlaying musical combinations on an existing space
- *Historical Narratives* - Presenting stories and other history-telling forms relating to the current space inhabited by the listener
- *Personal Narratives* - Incorporating personal speech from a narrator,  including environmental sounds local to the narrator, often set in the same space the listener is in

#### Experiments S.3-S.9

![Spiderman](../media/images/spiderman.png)

Taking inspiration from Cardiff/Miller and their soundwalks, I created a series of soundwalks that each focused on one of the strategies listed above. This exploration led to the publication of the paper [Experiments in Soundwalks for Video Games](https://www.cmmas.com/en/ideassonicas32/ideassonicas%2Fsonicideas-23) for the 23rd issue of [Sonic Ideas](https://www.cmmas.com/en/sonicideas).

One of the main take-aways from working on this series of experiments is how the medium of video game is a compelling space for thinking about what it means to be in the same space. If you and I are both playing _Spiderman 2_ we are clearly both in a fictional version of New York City, but there is also the possibility that I am in your living room/bedroom and you are in mine. Do the sounds of my controller, my children, and my physical space bleed into yours? Does this widen the soundscape into more complicated territory?

- Time / Slow Games
- Space & Movement / Aesthetic Architecture
- Rules? / the Rule of St Benedict? 
- Agency??

Side note: I am realizing that all of these could possibly be framed with Soundwalks as the connecting tissue, in which case the format might be more of:
- element A is in games
- here is how that is handled in Soundwalks
- here is how it is handled in other disciplines
- here is a series of experiments I made in reaction to this
