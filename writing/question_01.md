# Question 1

_"Reflection" as a concept has been leveraged across various disciplines and media forms, sometimes in relation to person as subject (i.e. reflective practitioner), sometimes in relation to person as object (i.e. designing for people to experience reflection). Discuss how reflection has been approached in different fields and whether the subject-object distinction makes a difference to how we understand reflection._

## Introduction

## Person as subject

Sch√∂n's "Reflective Practioner" and the thinkers that follow his understanding of the concept.
## Person as object

Designers who are making things for a user to experience reflection.
## External object?

Contemplation as reflection _through_ a thing, but pointing towards a third thing.
