# Question 1

_"Reflection" as a concept has been leveraged across various disciplines and media forms, sometimes in relation to person as subject (i.e. reflective practitioner), sometimes in relation to person as object (i.e. designing for people to experience reflection). Discuss how reflection has been approached in different fields and whether the subject-object distinction makes a difference to how we understand reflection._

Is this a question of 'reflection through design' vs 'reflection on design'..? Is there a better way to say this? Reflection on the design process. Reflection on the design object. Reflection through the design process. Reflection through the design object.

## Introduction

## Person as subject

_Reflection THROUGH the design process_

Schön's "Reflective Practitioner" and the thinkers that follow his understanding of the concept.

In his 1982 text "The Reflective Practitioner," Donald Schön sets up his argument for "reflection-in-action." In this understanding, the designer/practioner is constantly relying on past knowledge as they are in midst of the the creation process. This "knowing-in-action" works in partnership with a reflection on the material aspects of the design itself. Schön states, 

_"There is some puzzling, or troubling, or interesting phenomenon with which the individual is trying to deal. As he tries to make sense of it, he also reflects on the understandings which have been implicit in his action, understandings which he surfaces, criticizes, restructures, and embodies in further action."_

This reflection happens in the designer's mind, often unconsciously, as they work in dialogue with the process, materials, and a specific design goal. This idea was in contrast to the prevailing concept of applied theory, where the practitioner was taught the foundational rules of craft and then applied them. Instead, using the examples of architects, big-league baseball pitchers, jazz musicians, and more, Schön describes the phenomena of "thinking on your feet" as a practitioner makes these subtle changes towards a desired goal. Interestingly, he breaks free from Csikszentmihalyi's concept of "flow" stating that "much reflection-in-action" hinges on surprise." Where a flow state denotes that the practitioner is unencumbered during the process, it is the roadblocks and unexpected occurrances that lead to reflection. 

Since the publication of "Reflective Practitioner," Schön's concept of reflection-in-action has found footing amongst many in the design and education communities. Most notably, Christopher Frayling brought the idea to the research community, proposing the idea of "research through art and design" which builds on Schön's ideas of reflection-in-action. Frayling argued that in 'research through art and design' the creation process could be harnessed for artistic/designerly knowledge. His idea is that the process can answer the question "how can I tell what I think till I see what I make and do?" Interestingly, this research and knowledge-generation angle of reflection has found a strong foothold in the academic world, where 

Redstrom

In their paper “Pre-Reflection-in-Action: Rethinking Schön’s Reflective Practice Through the ‘Habits of Design Artistry,’” Eklund et al. take issue with Schön's use of 'conversation' in describing how the practitioner relates to their craft. They believe that this language misconstrues the underlying nature of that experience. Instead, they rely on John Dewey's notions of "thought-in-action" and especially "habit," arguing that "thought properly integrated within action is a matter of undergoing the immediate unfolding of situational-ideational qualities not representing—it is in essence ‘pre-reflective.’" In their estimation, Schön's use of the word 'conversation' divorces thought from action, when in reality the two are more intertwined. Putting all of this aside, their use of "pre-reflection" as a term still uses the practitioner/designer as the subject, merely focusing on the understanding of how exactly that reflection happens.

We can see this thinking echoed in Frank Chimero's "Shape of Design" where he states

"The creative process, in essence, is an individual in dialogue with themselves and the work. The painter, when at a distance from the easel, can assess and analyze the whole of the work from this vantage. He scrutinizes and listens, chooses the next stroke to make, then approaches the canvas to do it. Then, he steps back again to see what he’s done in relation to the whole. It is a dance of switching contexts, a pitter-patter pacing across the studio floor that produces a tight feedback loop between mark-making and mark-assessing. The artist, when near, is concerned with production; when far, he enters a mode of criticism where he judges the degree of benefit (or detriment) the previous choice has had on the full arrangement."

This "dance of switching contexts" can be seen in a number of artistic practices. It is the painter assessing his canvas, as Chimero states, but it is also the composer listening back to a piece on various speaker systems, the sculptor rotating a piece in their hands before firing, and the game designer adapting an experience based on feedback from a session of play.

Through all of these reflection sits squarely in the experience of the designer themselves. In this framework, it is the designer who reflects; the practitioner who assesses whether or not the thing they have made is successful.

_Reflection ON the design process_

Schoffelen, J. et al. "Making and reflecting via Playful Design Representations," 2013???

## Person as object

_Reflecting ON a design object_

In 2001, Lars Hallnäs and Johan Redström pusblished "Slow Technology - Designing For Reflection," which shifts the notion of reflection away from the design practice and instead on the designed object. They introduce the concept of "slow technology \[...] as a tool for making reflection inherent in design expression," believing that slowing down and building friction into designs will make the user reflect on the nature and role of technology in their life. 

Similarly, in their paper "Reflective Design," Phoebe Sengers et al. move Schön and Frayling's ideas of designerly reflection towards creating reflective experiences for the user. This shifts the focus of reflection away from the nature of the designed object and instead on the . Building on critical theory, they argue for design that brings "unconscious aspects of experience to conscious awareness, thereby making them available for conscious choice." Specifically, they "expand on reflection-in-action by not waiting for surprise to occur but by intervening to create or stimulate these reflection triggers." 

In "Questions Over Answers," Rilla Khaled proposes a 'reflective game design' that X. This understanding of reflection is centered around Dewey's concept of reflective thought, where a leaner gains new insights by being confronted with "a state of perplexity, surprise and doubt." 

Gibbons

Miller et al.'s "A Design Framework for Reflective Play," seeks to codify this goal of reflective play by setting forth a framework by which designers can engender those reflective experiences. 

In many of these understandings of reflection, the focus is on a thought process. Jennifer Moon states that "\[Reflection is] …a mental process of thinking about what we have done, learned and experienced." 

_Reflection THROUGH a design object_

## A Third Possibility? External object (Reflection itself as object)

Contemplation as reflection _through_ a thing, but pointing towards a third thing.
