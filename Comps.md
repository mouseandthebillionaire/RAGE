A collection of quotes, reflections, design ideas, musings, et cetera pertaining to the readings completed in preparation for comprehensive exams. (Starting June 6, 2024)

### Gibbons, Liam. “Strategies for the Design of Reflective Shortform Videogames,” 2020

Gibbons strategies for making games reflective are as follows (with accompanying pull-quotes and notes):

1. *Limit, omit, and make ambiguous formal ludic components such as explicit objectives and win/lose conditions.*

	- "by removing a formal ludic component from a game design, it becomes ambiguous, and player-defined" - This makes me think of the Sims, and I'm not convinced that by making objectives player-defined we necessarily make it reflective. Case in point, my forever example of player-defined objectives is "don't step on a crack" which I can't imagine that any child has ever reflected deeply on what that says about their relationship with their mother.

1. *Explicate but do not quantify spatiotemporal barriers.*

2. *Contain the various elements and dynamics of the game design within a single spatial cell.*

3. *Avoid interrupting or overtly directing the player’s engagement with the game system*
