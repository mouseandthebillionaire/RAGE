# Readings
(or, a study in GaR Lit)

A collection of quotes, reflections, design ideas, musings, et cetera pertaining to the readings completed in preparation for comprehensive exams. (Starting June 4, 2024)

### Gibbons, Liam. “Strategies for the Design of Reflective Shortform Videogames,” 2020

Gibbons strategies for making games reflective are as follows (with accompanying pull-quotes and notes):

1. *Limit, omit, and make ambiguous formal ludic components such as explicit objectives and win/lose conditions.*

	- "by removing a formal ludic component from a game design, it becomes ambiguous, and player-defined" - This makes me think of the Sims, and I'm not convinced that by making objectives player-defined we necessarily make it reflective. Case in point, my forever example of player-defined objectives is "don't step on a crack" which I can't imagine that any child has ever reflected deeply on what that says about their relationship with their mother.
	- Note: Gibbons then immediately quotes Costikyan as describing Sim City as a "software toy"
	- Okay, I buy this: "In the absence of such a pre-determined objective then, the actions and gestures of the player are no longer inherently desirable or damaging, as they do not move the player closer to victory or failure. As such, the player may decide the value of their actions, and the outcomes that they generate, for themselves." By framing the interaction as "ambiguous" we immediately acknowledge that the player is the one assigning meaning to any decisions.
	- This also aligns with my desire to make games that have neither good nor bad choices. Is it that the ambiguity of choice is inherently reflective? If the choice is obviously good/bad then there is no need to reflect on it? If a player is asked to remove a stone from play and that removal is obviously the right choice, they will probably just do it, yes? But if the stone is an animal and the removal is death? A harder choice? I'm not sure...

1. *Explicate but do not quantify spatiotemporal barriers.*
	- "To specifically elicit reflective play however, I found it useful to avoid quantifying my spatiotemporal barriers, boundaries, and limits. This is because a quantified spatiotemporal barrier shifts the character of the play that occurs within it towards competition, and away from reflection" - Common sense, a bit. Time limits, at least, guarantee for a focus on "winning." There is also an idea here about reflection being "outside of time." We can best and truly reflect only when we are not mindful of time's pressure.
	- Gibbons goes on to comment on the time limit imposed by Anna Anthropy in *Queers in love at the end of the world,* mentioning that the reflection can only happen at the *end* of the game. But this seems a valid use of time-restraint to cause reflection, yes? Similarly, can a silly arcade experience (Busy Work, Buy! Sell!) also create reflection? Are there ways to make the *aftermath* of a game experience more reflective?
	- It is worth noting that barriers aren't nearly as problematic in Gibbons' game [*Dream*](https://liamgibbonsphd.itch.io/dream) as the obvious presence of *goals.* I see a key and a door that is clearly locked, and so instead of reflecting I am immediately compelled to complete the task.

3. *Contain the various elements and dynamics of the game design within a single spatial cell.*

4. *Avoid interrupting or overtly directing the player’s engagement with the game system*
