# Experiments and Responses

A series of small experiments for reflection in games, primarily focusing on experimental interactions in p5.js and sound design in RNBO.

### Experiment 1 / Jun 19, 2024

It's a black circle. Touch it.

When the user hovers over the black circle it begins to slowly grow in size while the audio detunes and becomes more complex.

One interesting thing about this is that the act of holding the mouse over the circle becomes easier and easier and easier as the circle grows larger (until really the user doesn't need to do anything for it to continue). This feels in line with reflective or meditative experiences. It's often harder to get going, to decide to take time away from your thoughts or activities but then once you're going it's much easier to keep going. From my perspective the act of holding the mouse on the circle does bring about a bit of a calming experience (which, it's still to be determined wether or not \[probably not\] 'calming' is even a goal) But also, this feels focusing. There's just enough effort required of you from the start, and it is satisfying as those requirements become less and less.

Sonically, the sounds become lower and slower as the mouseover interaction progresses, which feels right. Additionally, there is a distortion *added*, and while this may initially feel like a weird decision, I think it works in a [Low "Hey What"](https://lowtheband.bandcamp.com/album/hey-what) kind of way (which, I feel is very soothing/reflective, but maybe not to all)
