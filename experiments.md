# Experiments and Responses

A series of small experiments for reflection in games, primarily focusing on experimental interactions in p5.js and sound design in RNBO.

### Experiment 1 // Jun 19, 2024

It's a black circle. Touch it.

When the user hovers over the black circle it begins to slowly grow in size while the audio detunes and becomes more complex.

One interesting thing about this is that the act of holding the mouse over the circle becomes easier and easier and easier as the circle grows larger (until really the user doesn't need to do anything for it to continue). This feels in line with reflective or meditative experiences. It's often harder to get going, to decide to take time away from your thoughts or activities but then once you're going it's much easier to keep going. From my perspective the act of holding the mouse on the circle does bring about a bit of a calming experience (which, it's still to be determined wether or not \[probably not\] 'calming' is even a goal) But also, this feels focusing. There's just enough effort required of you from the start, and it is satisfying as those requirements become less and less.

Sonically, the sounds become lower and slower as the mouseover interaction progresses, which feels right. Additionally, there is a distortion *added*, and while this may initially feel like a weird decision, I think it works in a [Low "Hey What"](https://lowtheband.bandcamp.com/album/hey-what) kind of way (which, I feel is very soothing/reflective, but maybe not to all)

### Experiment 2 // Jun 27, 2024

A white circle grows in...

How did a week go by and I'm only *now* doing this? Focusing on reading? "Living" with the last prototype? Lazy? Either way, yeesh.

After trying the first version, LLB suggested moving from atonal/distortion to tonal/clean and we thought a simple flip of the black/white would mirror that change. As much as I hate to admit, I think it does work better? Even without changing the base audio, there is something about moving *out* of the distortion that communicates "improvement."  

Some ideas arise for a third iteration or for implementation in new prototypes:

- PJB suggested non black/white as more interesting, which is a good idea as it also gets us away from the good/bad language but I do kind of like the blank canvas aspects of B/W. 
- I'd like this to get a little more character at some point (hand-drawn, sketchy, tikatmos/lthc-vibe) but I don't want to get bogged down in needing to stylize the whole thing. Hopefully have this happen organically as the thing evolves. That being said, I think the first step might be to swap out this ugly start button...
- I don't mind sitting with this playing for a while, but I might have a higher tolerance to microchanges in music than the common listener, so it is probably a good idea to add a second (third? fourth? fifth?) stage of musical movement and/or slightly more interesting changes. However, the visuals don't do anything once the circle fils the screen, so maybe that doesn't make sense? But maybe they could?
- Adding on to this, I had it playing in the background as I was writing up the journal entry and at some pint it refreshed to the start screen. I don't know if this was a p5 thing, or the localhost freaked out, but it brings up the problem of letting the thing grow and grow and grow which is unnecessary (and lazy) so should be addressed in any further iterations.
- For this version both the chimes and the chords are tuning as the interaction progresses, but it sound effective to have them retune at different speeds or have the chimes start in the root tone, causing them to move in out of phase/tune as the circle fills the screen.
- Side note: the number of times that I am typing too fast and swap the "ion" to "ino" in words (i.e distortion to distortino) is getting silly. The best way to acknowledge this fault in my typing skills is probably to have a project called something like EXPERIMENTINO)
