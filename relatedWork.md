### Bogost, I. "Relaxation" from *How to Do Things with Videogames,*  2011

Bogost has some interesting excursions into and around reflection in his essay on “Relaxation” in games. And there are definitely some parallels here, but it strikes me that the notion of “relaxing” and/or “zen” games remains in a different category than “reflective” games. The goal of a relaxing game is obviously to relax, and zen games are (per Bogost) “akin to doodling on a napkin or skimming through a magazine, or knitting in front of the television” (92) These really are the lean-back forms of games that Bogost is arguing towards here, where the mind becomes calmer through the activity. But in true “reflective” media is there this calmness? Are we “calm” when brought face to face with notions that challenge the way we have constructed the world around us?

Bogost’s mention of “meditation” and walking is a surprising turn that is obviously an interesting one for future work and writing. Baudelaire, Thoreau, obviously, but he also mentions medieval labyrinths, which are a great example of the kind of reflective activity I’m thinking of. Labyrinths are definitely (or can be) akin to the idea of knitting in front of the television. Activities to be doing while your mind is focused on something else. Is there something to be said for the busy-work of games freeing your mind to go elsewhere? Is this something that can be explored, but just hasn’t been talked about that much? Or is it a tenuous link?

Finally, this quote in his conclusion is pertinent “Relaxation and reflection arise from constrained environments in which the senses are de-emphasized and focused rather than escalated and expanded.” (95)

Is this true? Relaxation, maybe? But reflection? Are we reflecting if our senses have become de-emphasized? Focused, feels right, though. We do want our senses focused and honed in order to see things in a new way. Again, more work to be done by thinking about reflective architecture, and how that can be applied to games.
### Fullerton, T. "Slow Play" from *The Infinite Playground*, De Koven, B. 2020

"'Slow play' \[...] allows for, and even depends on, an internal and emotional process on the part of the player. This is play that nurtures that internal process through its design. its scope, and its pace."

"the process of making meaning through reflection requires time at a human pace and cycles of response, interpretation, and unpacking of experience."

It’s interesting to think about the place that time has in the success of possibility for reflective play. It does seem that for reflection to happen there also needs to be the time to reflect. But does that time necessarily have to happen with the timeframe of the game? Once we are outside of the magic circle, could we not continue to think about the experience that we just had and reflect on it? Additionally there is some space in longer experiences to build in these moments of reflection (what De Koven calls “interludes”) to provide a momentary reflection-time for the audience. The best theatre/cinema does this by necessity because a viewer cannot stop the action on the stage/screen.

This, then, opens up some interesting possibilities: an arcade game experience could be reflective if its content/nature/gameplay/(something else?) contained deep and thoughtful ideas. The player may feel like they are doing something frantic and mindless, but the moment thet stop, could reflection happen? Prior personal work like [_Busy Work_](http://www.mouseandthebillionaire.com/busyWork/) and [_Buy! Sell!_](http://www.mouseandthebillionaire.com/buySell) have perhaps tested this theory to varying degrees of success… It could be worthwhile to spend some time spent thinking about what this material "something" is that makes a piece of media appropriate for reflection.
### Gibbons, Liam. “Strategies for the Design of Reflective Shortform Videogames,” 2020

Gibbons strategies for making games reflective are as follows (with accompanying pull-quotes and notes):

1. *Limit, omit, and make ambiguous formal ludic components such as explicit objectives and win/lose conditions.*

	- "by removing a formal ludic component from a game design, it becomes ambiguous, and player-defined" - This makes me think of the Sims, and I'm not convinced that by making objectives player-defined we necessarily make it reflective. Case in point, my forever example of player-defined objectives is "don't step on a crack" which I can't imagine that any child has ever reflected deeply on what that says about their relationship with their mother.
	- Note: Gibbons then immediately quotes Costikyan as describing Sim City as a "software toy"
	- Okay, I buy this: "In the absence of such a pre-determined objective then, the actions and gestures of the player are no longer inherently desirable or damaging, as they do not move the player closer to victory or failure. As such, the player may decide the value of their actions, and the outcomes that they generate, for themselves." By framing the interaction as "ambiguous" we immediately acknowledge that the player is the one assigning meaning to any decisions.
	- This also aligns with my desire to make games that have neither good nor bad choices. Is it that the ambiguity of choice is inherently reflective? If the choice is obviously good/bad then there is no need to reflect on it? If a player is asked to remove a stone from play and that removal is obviously the right choice, they will probably just do it, yes? But if the stone is an animal and the removal is death? A harder choice? I'm not sure...

1. *Explicate but do not quantify spatiotemporal barriers.*
	- "To specifically elicit reflective play however, I found it useful to avoid quantifying my spatiotemporal barriers, boundaries, and limits. This is because a quantified spatiotemporal barrier shifts the character of the play that occurs within it towards competition, and away from reflection" - Common sense, a bit. Time limits, at least, guarantee for a focus on "winning." There is also an idea here about reflection being "outside of time." We can best and truly reflect only when we are not mindful of time's pressure.
	- Gibbons goes on to comment on the time limit imposed by Anna Anthropy in *Queers in love at the end of the world,* mentioning that the reflection can only happen at the *end* of the game. But this seems a valid use of time-restraint to cause reflection, yes? Similarly, can a silly arcade experience (Busy Work, Buy! Sell!) also create reflection? Are there ways to make the *aftermath* of a game experience more reflective?
	- It is worth noting that barriers aren't nearly as problematic in Gibbons' game [*Dream*](https://liamgibbonsphd.itch.io/dream) as the obvious presence of *goals.* I see a key and a door that is clearly locked, and so instead of reflecting I am immediately compelled to complete the task.

3. *Contain the various elements and dynamics of the game design within a single spatial cell.*

4. *Avoid interrupting or overtly directing the player’s engagement with the game system*

*“To understand how we might encourage reflective play within a short form therefore, we first need to understand how we can make room for that reflection and anticipation to occur during the player’s direct experience of a game, rather than after it.”*

I suppose that I can understand why Gibbons is looking specifically at how to create reflective experiences _during_ play, but I wonder if there is a real need? Perhaps his desire to make shortform games necessitates this a bit more, but doesn't the pause menu actually provide a perfect place for reflection to happen? Just as paragraph/section/chapter breaks allow the reader a natural place to stop the act of reading to filter it through their own experiences. Especially if chess is used as an example. With chess being such a rich space for theory, reflection, stories, etc, isn’t okay to reflect “during the pause menu” as it were? Or maybe when we reflect during a game of chess, we aren’t necessarily “pausing” the game? We are still within the game-space? Maybe then the question/practice/idea is to create a pause-state like functionality that doesn’t _feel_ like a pause-state. If you simply stop feeding input into the system it stays in a state of stasis without feeling removed from the game. It’s the difference between sitting with a furrowed brow and pondering your next move in chess and pushing back your chair, standing up, and walking away from the chess board. And maybe this is the better way of talking about this idea. A fluid pause-state that doesn’t take you out of the game, but still allows for this period of reflection.

It is also worth noting that I think my definition of reflection differs from Gibbons’.

*“reflection-based play activities make no immediate demands of the player, as I will discuss in more detail throughout this chapter. These activities allow or even require the player to think back and reflect upon past events and instances of reaction-based play, think forward and anticipate future events, and to consider and experiment with potential courses of action”*

While I don’t deny that these activities are “reflective” (in that the player is reflecting on the state of play) I find it slightly removed from reflection in the depper context that I am considering. I want to make some wider gulf between deep reflection and simply “thinking back on past play sessions and what might come next.” Gibbons’ use of reflection reminds me more of Bogost’s discussion of “lean back” media in “How to do Things with Videogames.”

### Jones, L. “Architectural Catalysts to Contemplation"

Jones' essay turns out to be less applicable than I had originally hoped, but there are still a few interesting things here. While she is focusing (as is the entire collection of which it is a part) on the specifically *religious* side of contemplation, the categorization of modes of sacred spaces into *theatric, sanctuary, and contemplative* is a useful way to think about making these spaces. 

Of sanctuary space she says "the demarcation of a “threshold,” that is, a boundary, limit, frontier, or picket between, in Eliadean terms, two “modes of being”—between “a profane outside” and “a sacred inside.” This feels in line with line with traditional game design (i.e Huiznga's) notion of the "magic circle," and supports the idea that these spaces can be used for more than just entertainment. Similarly, the move from passive/sanctuary space to active/contemplative space, where the architecture is helping aid in the act of contemplation, is an even more perfect argument and look into the possibility space.

After reading this article, I would like to do a cursory reading of the collection's third section (RESPONSE FROM ARCHITECTURAL PRACTICE) as it appears to have more practical/application-based content. 

### Koike, R. *The Practice of Not Thinking: A Guide to Mindful Living*

The “Three Kleshas (literally poisons) or disturbing emotions” are desire, anger, and uncertainty (6)

Q: Is there a way to either:
<ol type="a">
	<li>use this knowledge of the kleshas to help people *avoid* these feelings as they are playing a game, 
thus creating a more reflexive experience, or…</li>
	<li>*harness* the kleshas to take the player out of their normal routine, creating something more meaningful for them</li>
</ol>
This second idea is fairly interesting (but slightly disturbing to posit, obviously) BUT, if a normal “good” state in game-play is the flow-state, then wouldn’t we want to take the player out of that state to create a state of reflection? Or, again, can that reflection happen after when they consider the experience they’ve just had? We can also argue, though, that maybe this is what every puzzle does: puts a hard stop on flow and forces the player to confront some new idea and/or reality.

A follow-up question then becomes: *is there a way to create a non-puzzle puzzle-like experience (one that takes the player out of normal flow-state and helps them to have a shift in perception)?*
