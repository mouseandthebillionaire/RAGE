(or, a study in GaR Lit)

A collection of quotes, reflections, design ideas, musings, et cetera pertaining to the readings completed in preparation for comprehensive exams. (Starting June 4, 2024)

### "ABZU," n.d.

This feels like what I would classify as a contemplative/reflective experience, but it's fascinating to note that it doesn't look anything like what Rilla proposes for design qualities of reflective game design. Specifically:

- The simple puzzles have single answers -- though perhaps the narrative raises questions (Answers OVER Questions)
- It seems to focus on more of a stealth method of infusing values (Stealth OVER Clarity)
- The whole thing is a comfortable experience (Comfort OVER Disruption)
- It is very immersive (Immersion OVER Reflection)

Flow and Flower do the same thing, yes? So again what we are talking about here isn't a "reflective" game at all. It's a potential contemplative/meditative experience, but maybe not one that leads to any real-world knowledge gained. There is still value to this, obviously, but how do you talk about it?

### Austin, M. "Music Games," 2021

Not a *ton* here, but I particularly enjoyed the background on some music-games that I was not aware of or had forgotten about, including:
- [Quest for Fame (1995)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uka9EQLqlDc)
- [Dance Aerobics (1987)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ6V3D5kpsQ)
- [Musika (2007)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musika)
- [DropMix (2017)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DropMix)

Austin's classification of music games as either procedural/conceptual is very interesting, but less pertinent to this current project. There are a couple of additional essays from this collection (*The Cambridge Companion to Video Game Music*) that I may add to the list as they seem more useful, but I will wait until I actually read to make sure they are a good fit. These are Richard Stevens' "The Inherent Conflicts of Musical Interactivity in Video Games," and Elizabeth Medina-Gray's "Interacting with Soundscapes: Music, Sound Effects and Dialogue in Video Games" And dare I even *suggest* Dana Plank's "Audio and the Experience of Gaming: A Cognitive-Emotional Approach to Video Game Sound"..?

### Benjamin, W. "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction," 1936[^0]

_"Earlier much futile thought had been devoted to the question of whether photography is an art. The primary question‚Äîwhether the very invention of photography had not transformed the entire nature of art‚Äîwas not raised. Soon the film theoreticians asked the same ill-considered question with regard to the film."_ (15)

How telling that the same thing has passed for a) tv, b) comic books, c) video games. In general, this is the main takeaway for me from this essay. Not entirely helpful in the reflective/contemplative games discussion, but still fascinating. (Similarly, Benjamin's explanation of Duhamel's critiques of film on p. 33. -- "a pastime for helots, a diversion for uneducated").

_"The audience‚Äôs identification with the actor is really an identification with the camera. Consequently the audience takes the position of the camera; its approach is that of testing."_ (18)

I like this claim, and it makes me wonder if there isn't some thought to be thunk about how this works in an interactive (i.e game) setting. Camera still, obviously, but also other things (freedom, challenge, etc) that complicate this.

Also fairly unrelated, but section XIII in which Benjamin discusses psychology and its impact on the permanence of words spoken between people ("Fifty years ago, a slip of the tongue passed more or less unnoticed") is fascinating, especially when we think about this from the present context of social media / digital traces of ourselves online. 

_"it is difficult to say which is more fascinating, its artistic value or its value for science To demonstrate the identity of the artistic and scientific uses of photography which heretofore usually were separated will be one of the revolutionary functions of the film."_ (29)

Can the same be said of computers and games (or software)?

_"One of the foremost tasks of art has always been the creation of a demand which could be fully satisfied only later"_ (30) üòª

_"Distraction and concentration form polar opposites which may be stated as follows: A man who concentrates before a work of art is absorbed by it. He enters into this work of an the way legend tells of the Chinese painter when he viewed his finished painting. In contrast, the distracted mass absorbs the work of art. This is most obvious with regard to buildings. Architecture has always represented the prototype of a work of art the reception of which is consummated by a collectivity in a state of distraction. The laws of its reception are most instructive"_ (33)

The Penguin edition has "the person who stands in *contemplation* before a work of art" here, which obviously grabs my attention. And it raises a good distinction: concentration v. contemplation. Are the masses concentrating on games? Additionally, the image of the masses absorbing the work into themselves is poetically salient, and feels true with video games. They leave the hand of the creator and become something else, sometimes unintended. The audience isn't informed? Something to dwell on here.

_"The public is an examiner, but an absent-minded one."_ (35)

### Bermudez, J. Introduction to *Transcending Architecture*, 2015

Some really nice thoughts in here. Bermudez's definition of architecture that "transcends" feels particularly helpful: 
	"They are talking of an architecture that has removed the 'opacity' hiding life‚Äôs meanings so that we can catch a momentous and revelatory (even if unsettling) glimpse"

This feels more aligned with what I think of as reflection than I have found before. An artistic reflection vs. an educational one. A reflection that includes a stepping back but not necessarily a re-evaluation or change in preconceived ideas. Bermudez goes on to add:
	"We should also notice that these qualifiers are referring to something ‚Äúother than‚Äù or ‚Äúbeyond‚Äù architecture. It is as if the experience of the building has exceeded the building, passing, as it were, through it into another realm that defies all words or gauging."

It is this passing on or beyond that I believe games can do well (as perhaps all great art does?) The subject material and the activity goes beyond narrative topics and the mechanics of play into something deeper. Beyond.

### Bijsterveld, K. "Modes of Listening: Why, How and to What?" 2019

I like this quote from Sophie Gibling's 1918 essay "Types of Musical Listening" about "the lis- tener ‚Äúwho is no listener at all, who passively sits through a concert, intellectually contributing nothing; waiting, like a cabbage or a stone, for something to happen to him. He hears without listening" (Gibling 386)

Likewise, Barry Truax's three modes from *Acoustic Communication* (2001/1984)
- background listening (not achieving any practical purpose)
- listening-in-readiness (recognize a vehivle by its sound)
- listening-in-search (a ship captain's whistle used for echo-orientation)

Bijsterveld separates out "purposes" and "ways" of listening (why/how) for 9 possible combinations. (67) This is a great framework in which to think about how players are engaging with audio in games. Even before learning what these are, I would assume that the general game audience is engaged with only one or two of these. Let's find out!

Purposes
- Monitory: checking for malfunctions, as you would while driving a car. Used often within sonification and auditory displays (as with medical devices) Listening to see *weather* something is wrong
- Diagnostic: Listening to see what exactly is wrong
- Exploratory: listening for something new

Ways
- Synthetically: wholistic listening (the whole orchestra)
- Analytically: for specific sounds (the second oboe)
- Interactively: the listener decides to replace the second oboe with a didgeridoo halfway through in order to better grasp the dynamics of the piece (71)

Bjisterveld is specifically talking about how scientists, engineers, and physicians listen here, so this may not be as useful as in those cases. The Truax typology listed above may be more helpful. However, she claims that Truax is looking at different *degrees* of attention while this is focusing on different *kinds,* and this feels like a good way to think about it. But what are the different kinds of listening that exist for entertainment? Are they the same as here? Different? Additionally, she claims they are not just in the mind, but linked to bodily actions as well (as in the way a doctor uses a stethoscope), which is great. (72)

### Blesser, B. et al. *Spaces Speak, Are You Listening*, 2007

A really fascinating (and probably overly thorough...) look at the subject, but I think that GD's summary actually says it best 

_"We focus often on the 'what', in game audio, what sounds, notes you build the music out of, and how they are connected with the 'what' of the game, characters, actions, emotions, ambiences. We also think a lot about when, the whole idea of non-linear time in game audio (and ambient music). But often not enough on the 'where'. And there‚Äôs an interesting reflection to do on the concept of the game as a¬†space,¬†and the often subconscious way in which elements such as reverberation change the emotional reception of sound/music, like filters on a film.¬†Essentially thinking of the game space as not just a 'box' in which you put your music, but as something which is¬†in dialogue¬†with the music, and how the user‚Äôs experience is the result of this interaction between score and space."_ (Dimitrov, personal communication)

This also ties in nicely with Bijsterfeld's "Why, How, and What" of listening (above), and perhaps a good way to take this for future writing. Transferring this to sound *design* (rather than listening) can we start outlining:
- What sounds are we using
- How are we using those sounds (and how are we expecting them to be used, i.e informational, thematic, mood)
- Why are we using them (what information is being carried)
- Where are these sounds taking place.

_"Although we may not be consciously aware that aural architecture is itself a sensory stimulus, we react to it. We may experience a living room as cold or warm independent of its actual temperature, or a train station as lonely and forbidding independent of its actual appearance. The acoustics of a grand cathedral can create an exalted mood; those of a chapel can enhance the privacy of quiet contemplation; those of an elevator can produce the feeling of encapsulation and, in the extreme, claustrophobia. The acoustics of an open area can produce feelings of either freedom or insecurity."_ (2)

The social aspects of aural architecture is also really interesting, Bare marble announces visitors, while muted carpet and heavy drapery communicates comfort (and perhaps privacy?) "The aural architecture of the lobby thus determines whether entering is a public or private event." (3)

Chapter 2 on auditory spatial awareness is fascinating, but perhaps as a bit less to do with my specific areas of focus (though the idea that you can communicate spatial clues to the listener/player is probably one to explore. I'm sure this is already happening in games, and could easily find some successful \[and unsuccessful\] examples) Also, the found aspects of this awareness (social, navigational, aesthetic, and musical) also feel like they could tie in nicely with Bijlsterfeld's typology. (12) Also feels related to Holm's design values?

The model of auditory awareness used here could also really useful (raw sensation -> perception -> emotionally-engaged listening) at least as a different way to explain the Traux typology. (This is also referred to as sensation(detection), perception (recognition) and affect (meaningfulness) on page 14) Additionally, Blesser et al reference Michael Chion's three kinds of listening as "casual, semantic, reduced" (182)

_"‚ÄòThe iceman had a couple of very heavy cobs...the coalman had a pair of substantial Percherons that always walked . . . the dry-goods store had a lightweight horses . . . and the Chinese vegetable men had very lazy horses.‚Äô In a town with acoustically porous living spaces, you could hear the fishing boats returning to harbor, the children walking home from school, the rattling of leaves in the wind, and the dog fighting with the cat. You would know that it was time to visit your neighbors when you heard their wagon returning from shopping. Sitting at home, and without moving from your chair, you were intimately connected to the activities on your street."_ (30)

Great example of how to think of spaces in nature, private, and public (27). Additionally the concept of public spaces seeping into private (and vice-versa) is great.

_"Unlike practitioners of vocal religions, Quakers value silent prayer as a way to distinguish that activity from the profanity of ordinary speech. They regulate silence using strong rules that forbid transgressing on the religious commons (Bauman, 1983). Group silence is the ultimate manifestation of social cohesiveness because silence can exist only if all members cease from speaking‚Äîtotal deference to the group‚Äôs values. When silence dominates, vocalized prayer takes on special meaning: voices framed by the boundaries of silence rather than lost in an ocean of sound. Silence is the central component in many religions and rituals (Szuchewycz, 1997)."_ (33) -- SILENCE

_"the Protestant Reformation shifted to smaller churches, in part, as the means to elevate the importance of the spoken liturgy, which would have been un-intelligible in the acoustics of a large cathedral."_ (65) -- The qualities of an aural space can be fueled by social values. (which is primarily what chapter 3 is about)

_"During the last century, we witnessed two revolutionary shifts in the way we conceive of musical space. First, the recording technology of the early twentieth century split musical space temporally, spatially, socially, and artistically‚Äîpartitioning what, when, and by whom music could be heard. In doing so, it added many new participants to the process of creating spatial experiences. The computer technology of the late twentieth century then virtualized the space where the music would be heard, how it would be created, and who would be responsible for its aural architecture. As this pattern of virtualization continues, musical space will merge ever more completely with musical instruments, with both becoming ever more abstract."_ (133)

_"The application of aural architecture to cinema is a good example of aesthetically pleasing spatial rules that never presume a space as a real environment. The sound tracks that create the aural image of a space complement the visual image appearing on screen without requiring consistency. The two spaces, one for each sense modality, are neither externally consistent with each other nor internally consistent within themselves. Visual space is constantly switching perspective and distance. Looking at the world through the eye of the camera, a viewer floats through space, penetrates walls, and instantly appears in a remote environment. Meanwhile, for the purposes of creating a mood or telling a story, an aural space may be a mixture of an intimate conversation in a bedroom, soothing music in a cathedral, and natural sounds from an open space. By itself, either the aural or visual space can abruptly change without apol- ogy or warning. In fact, unrelated aural and visual spaces often coexist simultaneously, as for example, observing an automobile race while listening to an intimate conversation in a bedroom."_ (160) -- Film as an example of successful aural architecture in arts media

"_a new branch of the spatial disciplines family appeared in the context of multimedia computer games with interactive audio. This will likely be a new home for aural architects, and especially for innovators who try to match aural to visual spaces._" (294) 

"_We now understand why musical and religious spaces are the most prominent forms of aural architecture. Such spaces emphasize the affective experience, and listeners may feel that the space has personal significance_" (335)

### Bogost, I. "Relaxation" from *How to Do Things with Videogames,*  2011

Bogost has some interesting excursions into and around reflection in his essay on ‚ÄúRelaxation‚Äù in games. And there are definitely some parallels here, but it strikes me that the notion of ‚Äúrelaxing‚Äù and/or ‚Äúzen‚Äù games remains in a different category than ‚Äúreflective‚Äù games. The goal of a relaxing game is obviously to relax, and zen games are (per Bogost) ‚Äúakin to doodling on a napkin or skimming through a magazine, or knitting in front of the television‚Äù (92) These really are the lean-back forms of games that Bogost is arguing towards here, where the mind becomes calmer through the activity. But in true ‚Äúreflective‚Äù media is there this calmness? Are we ‚Äúcalm‚Äù when brought face to face with notions that challenge the way we have constructed the world around us?

Bogost‚Äôs mention of ‚Äúmeditation‚Äù and walking is a surprising turn that is obviously an interesting one for future work and writing. Baudelaire, Thoreau, obviously, but he also mentions medieval labyrinths, which are a great example of the kind of reflective activity I‚Äôm thinking of. Labyrinths are definitely (or can be) akin to the idea of knitting in front of the television. Activities to be doing while your mind is focused on something else. Is there something to be said for the busy-work of games freeing your mind to go elsewhere? Is this something that can be explored, but just hasn‚Äôt been talked about that much? Or is it a tenuous link?

Finally, this quote in his conclusion is pertinent 
	‚ÄúRelaxation and reflection arise from constrained environments in which the senses are de-emphasized and focused rather than escalated and expanded.‚Äù (95)

Is this true? Relaxation, maybe? But reflection? Are we reflecting if our senses have become de-emphasized? Focused, feels right, though. We do want our senses focused and honed in order to see things in a new way. Again, more work to be done by thinking about reflective architecture, and how that can be applied to games.

### Bukvic, I. "Introduction to Sonification," 2019

Good definition for sonification as "the acoustic representation of data for relational interpretation by listeners, for the purpose of increasing their knowledge of the source from which the data was acquired." (195) Additionally, a good reminder of the paramters that we mainly think about when designing for sonification: pitch, loudness, timbre, duration, location. (198) Otherwise a good refernece for some basic sonification ideas, techniques, and theories (if those things are needed). 

### Dalsgaard, P. et al. "Reflective Design Documentation," 2012

First things first: the number of times "wicked/wickedness" is used in the introduction is bananas.

The initial statements about the challenges designers face is great, but the discussion of the overall idea and implementation of the software system seems lacking.

_"A strategy for data capture that focuses on specific and well-defined questions most often seems to prompt relatively restricted discussions of the existing research questions"_ (435)

### Djebbara, Z. et al. "Contemplative neuroaesthetics and architecture: A sensorimotor exploration," 2023

_"we define mindfulness as a state of non-judgmental awareness and focused attention on the present moment, while contemplation as a state of intense concentration, introspection, and open or directed consideration"_ (98) 

Very useful demarcation of contemplation apart from mindfulness. This definition also feels separate from all of the "reflection" definitions floating around. The phrases 'introspection' and 'open consideration' feel especially helpful (introspection, in particular feels more open-ended, less goal-oriented, than the way reflection is used)

_"the brain and body can in both cases engage in contemplative practice to increase well-being by being involved in a heightened level of awareness and presence. That is, the experience of appreciation associated with contemplative practice is itself an aesthetic experience, particularly if it is externally induced."_ (98)

The concept of externally-induced (EX-I) means of reaching contemplative states is helpful. Likewise, it is interesting to note that architects (as *functional* aesthetic practitioners) value them because of the "performative" success of values. All of this seems to align with at least some of how we can think about video games. Are they also "functionally" aesthetic objects? Obviously they are entertainment properties and have less of a function than a building, but for some reason I feel like there is something here. 

_" contemplative practices have been found to significantly improve cognitive and affective performances, enhance immunological response, foster brain growth and plasticity, provide a better sense of well-being, reduce stress, depression, loneliness, anxiety, increase motivation, and raise pain thresholds (Keng et al., 2011; Sumantry and Stewart, 2021)"_ (98) -- why contemplation matters (outside of religious practice)

Contemplation is defined here as:
_"Contemplation: an intentionally induced state of awareness characterized by present-centeredness, focused and sustained attention, relaxation, decreased mind-wandering, and absence of judgment (Boccia et al., 2015; Bond et al., 2009; Cahn and Polich 2006; Lutz et al., 2008a, 2008b; Nash and Newberg, 2013; Tang et al., 2015)"_ (99)

_"There are remarkable ex- amples of contemporary art and architecture that seek the contemplative, e.g., the works of the light artist James Turrell, the painter Mark Rothko, and the architect Tadao Ando, by integrating and enforcing an embodied experience of presence."_ (100)

_"architecture can lead to contemplative states by enabling individuals to become sensible of the attunement process. When we are in tune with architecture, we engage our body with the external built environment, effortlessly reaching a non-judgmental flow and resonance that leave very little room for analytical thought (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990; Vara Sa ÃÅnchez, 2022, 2023)"_ (101)

Fun to see Csikszentmihalyi's flow being used in a non-game context. (and obviously great to see how an obviously flow-focused medium like games could also use an argument like the one above)

On page 102 Djebbara et al. argue that we need to "move beyond perception by addressing the underlying processes that enable human experiences," which is in line with the perception -> emotionally-engaged listening typology from Blesser, Bjisterveld, etc. We're getting somewhere here! It does not seem too outrageous to start thinking about a **perception/playing -> deeply-engaged/playing** typology...

![[media/images/ex-I_in-I.png]]

I have been thinking about the left to center (IN-I)techniques through the on-going [experiments](experiments.md), but clearly these ideas of the EX-I (right to centre) are a valuable place to be looking.

_"when the appropriate architectural circumstances are in place, directing attention to sensorimotor processes offers a more familiar or natural (and therefore easier) way to initiate contemplative states than quieting the mind on demand by the IN-I mind training"_ (106)

Another great Juhani Pallasmaa quote!

"_When experiencing a structure, we unconsciously mimic its configuration with bones and muscles; the pleasurably animated flow of a piece of music is subconsciously transformed into bodily sensations, the composition of an abstract painting is experienced as tensions to the muscular system. The structures of a building are un- consciously imitated and comprehended through the skeletal system unknowingly, as we perform the task of the column or the vault with our body. (Holl et al., 2006)_" (104)

p. 105 good quotes from people experiencing contemplative states from engaging with architecture (Salk Institute, Therme Vals Bath, Chartres)

### Droumeva, M. "Soundwalking in Games," 2023

_"Soundwalking is a performative method that relies on real-time presence and intentional movement through either physical or virtual space."_ (2.1) -- good definition

After reading Djebbara et al. my thoughts on how soundwalking builds on the concept of "flaneur" has changed. We can see that this is obviously coming from the IN-I understanding, where the individual's actions on the space is responsible for creating reflection/contemplation. "In virtual space, the flaÃÇneur might subvert the intended narrative by paying attention to sound thus creating new bio-political objectives rooted in the multimodal geography of gamespace, and not in the win-condition of the game" (2.1) It is the participant who is responsible for making this happen, not the spaces themselves. Teaching a player to breathe/listen/slow-down vs. making that a natural outcome of the space. Can we argue that the Cardiff audio walks are in the EX-I (right to centre) category, while the Neuhaus 'LISTEN' project is IN-I?

Note: I agree with all of Droumeva's thoughts on *Season* (4.0.1) (though it should be mentioned that I read this *before* playing the game). Also, "climate grief game" is a real bummer of a category...

## Eklund, A. et al. ‚ÄúPre-Reflection-in-Action: Rethinking Sch√∂n‚Äôs Reflective Practice Through the ‚ÄòHabits of Design Artistry," 2023

In general, a shifting of the ideas of Sch√∂n's 'reflective practice' towards Dewey's "artistic practice," specifically by claiming that Son leans on Dewey's idea's but misses some key/useful elements.

_"it has been claimed that SchoÃàn overlooks Dewey‚Äôs special characterization of experience3 and downplays his emphasis on the embodied, social nature of action."_ (2)

Eklund et al's main problem seems to be that Sch√∂n's idea of 'conversation' communicates (pardon my use here) too strongly a thoughtful back and forth between artist/designer and practice/material, when in reality it tends to be more innate. _"Despite the apparent neatness of the above, we note a tension between the supposed immediacy of the artistry described and inherent mediation of conversational metaphor."_ (4) 

More arguments from them (all p. 5):
- "For Dewey, rather than a purely mental phenomena, thought was to be understood as being of the body, which, in turn, was to be understood as being of the environment"
- "Thus, thought properly integrated within action is a matter of undergoing the immediate unfolding of situational-ideational qualities not representing‚Äîit is in essence ‚Äòpre-reflective‚Äô"
- "The difference in terms of practice is enormous as artists are said to ‚Äòthink directly‚Äô in terms of relations of qualities (i.e., they do not take the detour via words or numbers)."

But overall I find this argument fairly pedantic? We understand the idea of a conversation with materials not as an actual conversation, right? A conversation that can happen at speeds to feel/look like instinct. I don't think we need another framework to think about how that appears simply based on language and mental-model differences. But fun to look at the practice through a slightly different lens.

### Eyles, M. et al. "Playful Ambience," 2011

A pretty interesting exploration on what it would mean to have ambient play in the true Brian Eno *Music for Airports* sense. Their understanding of the 'fundamental properties' pf ambience are of note (2):

- different levels of engagement by players
- different levels of affect
- persistence of the game when players are not present
- context of the game (where, when, who)

Reading this, I thought frequently about [Jaaniste's *Approaching the Ambient*](### jaaniste,) and how those two understandings of 'ambience' diverge. Eyles et al. feel more in line with what Eno is actually proposing, i.e a music (or other media) that can fluctuate between background and foreground, and this understanding is more compelling from a game design perspective. Likewise, their understanding of the *effect* of ambient music is useful, where it "creates a mood and may affect the way the listener is perceiving, or thinking about, the location" (3).

The first experiment listed (where a pedometer controls the movement of an in-game character) generated a lot of ideas for me. I like the idea of a player-character that you can only control *how much* they move, and not any other qualities. They could be a terrible person and so then the goal becomes to move as little as possible so they do't succeed in their awful tasks. Or they merely procrastinate and you move as much as possible, hoping that they'll get their required tasks done, but when you log-on to check on them you find that they're still playing Candy Crush. [This is a good idea](https://i.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExMG80M2wxeWRsZ3JjZ2lkdTE0cnBsYXlzdnIzbW5pejU1b2VwbmUybSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/mFYxjzJO3zzNqGAwee/giphy.gif).

Over all, I think that this exploration leads to some great discoveries about creating ambient work, and much of this will most likely feed into my research as it continues. The discussion of  different levels of engagement (11) and perceived challenges (9) are especially fruitful.

_"For games with high levels of ambience the perceived complexity should allow different levels of engagement, including the ability to have a very low level of engagement. One consequence of giving players the possibility of engaging at a low level means that it should be possible to perceive the game as having a low level of complexity and hence easily engage with it."_ (11)

### Fullerton, T. "Slow Play" from *The Infinite Playground*, De Koven, B. 2020

"'Slow play' \[...] allows for, and even depends on, an internal and emotional process on the part of the player. This is play that nurtures that internal process through its design. its scope, and its pace."

"the process of making meaning through reflection requires time at a human pace and cycles of response, interpretation, and unpacking of experience."

It‚Äôs interesting to think about the place that time has in the success of possibility for reflective play. It does seem that for reflection to happen there also needs to be the time to reflect. But does that time necessarily have to happen with the timeframe of the game? Once we are outside of the magic circle, could we not continue to think about the experience that we just had and reflect on it? Additionally there is some space in longer experiences to build in these moments of reflection (what De Koven calls ‚Äúinterludes‚Äù) to provide a momentary reflection-time for the audience. The best theatre/cinema does this by necessity because a viewer cannot stop the action on the stage/screen.

This, then, opens up some interesting possibilities: an arcade game experience could be reflective if its content/nature/gameplay/(something else?) contained deep and thoughtful ideas. The player may feel like they are doing something frantic and mindless, but the moment thet stop, could reflection happen? Prior personal work like [_Busy Work_](http://www.mouseandthebillionaire.com/busyWork/) and [_Buy! Sell!_](http://www.mouseandthebillionaire.com/buySell) have perhaps tested this theory to varying degrees of success‚Ä¶ It could be worthwhile to spend some time spent thinking about what this material "something" is that makes a piece of media appropriate for reflection.

### Flusser, V. *The Shape of Things*, 1999

_"This new human being in the process of being born all around us and within us is in fact without hands. He does not handle things anymore, so in his case one cannot speak of actions anymore. Nor of practice, nor of work for that matter. The only things left of his hands are the tips of his fingers, which he uses to tap on keys so as to play with symbols. The new human being is not a man of action anymore but a player: homo ludens as opposed to homo faber."_ (91)

So much prescience in Flusser's essays, but this feels exceptionally so. Additionally the following line that "life is not a drama for him, but a performance." Really, this whole paragraph should go in here, but trying to focus in on a smaller portion. But yes, especially in my own work, performance is a key aspect. Creating performative opportunities for unnexpected joy. Experiences that are just as fun to watch as they are to play. A positive spin on the darker aspects that Flusser is highlighting. And there are a number of examples of this within the world of games/play, but the few that come to mind most readily are *JS Joust, DDR, [Disunion](https://vimeo.com/65510054)*. Does organized sport fit in here as well? We could argue that in sport performance is *far* more important than fun.

### Frayling, C. "Research n Art and Design," 1993

Rereading Frayling, that distinction of research *for* art and research *through* art stands out (obviously), and I wonder where my own "research" fits in as I continue this process. Clearly I am researching methods, techniques, ideas, etc that can be used to create specific contemplative/reflective experiences (for), but the comprehensive exam process itself (reading, playing games, writing) is *also* fairly contemplative/reflective. This creates a really fascinating combination/overlap. In fact, are both of these not research *for*? The techniques research fits in with materials research, and while Frayling might categorize the precedent research as research *into*, it feels more like research *for* a specific outcome. Truly whole practice truly is part of the research, as Frayling states: 

_"Research is a practice, writing is a practice, doing science is a practice, doing design is a practice, making art is a practice. The brain controls the hand which informs the brain. To separate art and design from all other practices, and to argue that they alone are in a diflerent world. is not only conceptually strange. it may well be artecidal (to use Stuart Macdonald's word)."_ (4) [^0]

[^0]: how unfortunate is the use of 'artecidal' here? I feel like these statements would have more sway without it.

### Galloway, K. "Soundwalking and the Aurality of *StarDew Valley*," 2019

This strikes me as a similar approach (at least partly) to Chang's *Playing Nature,* in that the focus is on how digital media can point back out to real physical natural phenomena. I don't deny the power of sound to help with this, but I wonder if there isn't more here, i.e *how can we experience the 'aurality' of* Stardew Valley *as it's own entity, unrelated to the outside world.* Galloway hints at some of this, particularly when she discusses the gulf between character and player

_" I, the player, could hear this music layered over the ambient soundscape, but I wondered what was audible to Darby and the other non-player characters (NPCs) from their unique listening perspectives."_ (167)

"What does it sound like to *be* in *Stardew Valley*" becomes a different question than "What does it feel like to *play Stardew Valley*?" In general, Galloway's switch to these perspectives for the remainder of the essay is interesting. That separation of avatar and player is a really compelling one, and I wodner what a game would look like where the avatar hears things that the player does not (and vice versa).
### Gibbons, Liam. ‚ÄúStrategies for the Design of Reflective Shortform Videogames,‚Äù 2020

Gibbons strategies for making games reflective are as follows (with accompanying pull-quotes and notes):

1. *Limit, omit, and make ambiguous formal ludic components such as explicit objectives and win/lose conditions.*

	- "by removing a formal ludic component from a game design, it becomes ambiguous, and player-defined" - This makes me think of the Sims, and I'm not convinced that by making objectives player-defined we necessarily make it reflective. Case in point, my forever example of player-defined objectives is "don't step on a crack" which I can't imagine that any child has ever reflected deeply on what that says about their relationship with their mother.
	- Note: Gibbons then immediately quotes Costikyan as describing Sim City as a "software toy"
	- Okay, I buy this: "In the absence of such a pre-determined objective then, the actions and gestures of the player are no longer inherently desirable or damaging, as they do not move the player closer to victory or failure. As such, the player may decide the value of their actions, and the outcomes that they generate, for themselves." By framing the interaction as "ambiguous" we immediately acknowledge that the player is the one assigning meaning to any decisions.
	- This also aligns with my desire to make games that have neither good nor bad choices. Is it that the ambiguity of choice is inherently reflective? If the choice is obviously good/bad then there is no need to reflect on it? If a player is asked to remove a stone from play and that removal is obviously the right choice, they will probably just do it, yes? But if the stone is an animal and the removal is death? A harder choice? I'm not sure...

1. *Explicate but do not quantify spatiotemporal barriers.*
	- "To specifically elicit reflective play however, I found it useful to avoid quantifying my spatiotemporal barriers, boundaries, and limits. This is because a quantified spatiotemporal barrier shifts the character of the play that occurs within it towards competition, and away from reflection" - Common sense, a bit. Time limits, at least, guarantee for a focus on "winning." There is also an idea here about reflection being "outside of time." We can best and truly reflect only when we are not mindful of time's pressure.
	- Gibbons goes on to comment on the time limit imposed by Anna Anthropy in *Queers in love at the end of the world,* mentioning that the reflection can only happen at the *end* of the game. But this seems a valid use of time-restraint to cause reflection, yes? Similarly, can a silly arcade experience (Busy Work, Buy! Sell!) also create reflection? Are there ways to make the *aftermath* of a game experience more reflective?
	- It is worth noting that barriers aren't nearly as problematic in Gibbons' game [*Dream*](https://liamgibbonsphd.itch.io/dream) as the obvious presence of *goals.* I see a key and a door that is clearly locked, and so instead of reflecting I am immediately compelled to complete the task.

3. *Contain the various elements and dynamics of the game design within a single spatial cell.*

4. *Avoid interrupting or overtly directing the player‚Äôs engagement with the game system*

*‚ÄúTo understand how we might encourage reflective play within a short form therefore, we first need to understand how we can make room for that reflection and anticipation to occur during the player‚Äôs direct experience of a game, rather than after it.‚Äù*

I suppose that I can understand why Gibbons is looking specifically at how to create reflective experiences _during_ play, but I wonder if there is a real need? Perhaps his desire to make shortform games necessitates this a bit more, but doesn't the pause menu actually provide a perfect place for reflection to happen? Just as paragraph/section/chapter breaks allow the reader a natural place to stop the act of reading to filter it through their own experiences. Especially if chess is used as an example. With chess being such a rich space for theory, reflection, stories, etc, isn‚Äôt okay to reflect ‚Äúduring the pause menu‚Äù as it were? Or maybe when we reflect during a game of chess, we aren‚Äôt necessarily ‚Äúpausing‚Äù the game? We are still within the game-space? Maybe then the question/practice/idea is to create a pause-state like functionality that doesn‚Äôt _feel_ like a pause-state. If you simply stop feeding input into the system it stays in a state of stasis without feeling removed from the game. It‚Äôs the difference between sitting with a furrowed brow and pondering your next move in chess and pushing back your chair, standing up, and walking away from the chess board. And maybe this is the better way of talking about this idea. A fluid pause-state that doesn‚Äôt take you out of the game, but still allows for this period of reflection.

It is also worth noting that I think my definition of reflection differs from Gibbons‚Äô.

*‚Äúreflection-based play activities make no immediate demands of the player, as I will discuss in more detail throughout this chapter. These activities allow or even require the player to think back and reflect upon past events and instances of reaction-based play, think forward and anticipate future events, and to consider and experiment with potential courses of action‚Äù*

While I don‚Äôt deny that these activities are ‚Äúreflective‚Äù (in that the player is reflecting on the state of play) I find it slightly removed from reflection in the depper context that I am considering. I want to make some wider gulf between deep reflection and simply ‚Äúthinking back on past play sessions and what might come next.‚Äù Gibbons‚Äô use of reflection reminds me more of Bogost‚Äôs discussion of ‚Äúlean back‚Äù media in ‚ÄúHow to do Things with Videogames.‚Äù

### Goudarzi, V. "Sound Design in the Context of Sonification," 2022

Some light history of sound design and sonification more expressly, and a few quotes that could come in handy...

_"Although sonification started as a purely scientific field, practitioners have started to appreciate humanities and aesthetic approaches in auditory display design in recent years"_(256) references Michael Filimowicz's "Piercing Fritz and Snow: An aesthetic field for sonified data." (2014)

### Halln√§s, L et al. "Expressions: Towards a Design Practice of Slow Technology," 2001

Halln√§s et al "describe Slow Technology \[as] technology aimed at promoting moments of reflection and mental rest" (abstract) which again, feels like it is in line with what I think about when I describe reflection: "mental rest" over "insight." I enjoy all of the examples in this paper; how they are built experiments from the team and what the implications of those objects might be for slow technology and reflection.

This week I tried out "slow games" as a way to think/speak about the experiments that I am engaging with, but it is too confusing/close to the idea of cozy games to work well, I think.

_"We have taken the exploration of temporal structures and different time-spans as a starting point for an investigation of the aesthetics of computational material"_ (2.1)

This is also a great way of framing the exploration; thinking of the aesthetical properties of an experience. Perhaps this is a better way of talking about the overall structure of the exploration? Pushing on reflective/contemplative/slow "*aesthetics*" over "experiences."

_"Aesthetics: When we want to find out more about the intrinsic expressions of computational technology as material for design, we sometimes have to disregard functionality"_ (6.4)

### Halln√§s and Redstr√∂m. ‚ÄúSlow Technology - Designing For Reflection,‚Äù 2001

A companion paper to the Expressions paper above, this gives further examples (some external) of what "slow technology" may look like. Their reference of other phrases is useful ("calm technology" and "ambient media") and I have looked at papers touching on these throughout the comps time. Their idea of slow technology is dealing primarily with ubiquitous computing which is extremely fascinating, but pertains less to traditional video game play. However, there is clearly a space for this when thinking about future experiments, with Kara Stone's [Ritual of the Moon](**[https://karastone.itch.io/ritual-of-the-moon](https://karastone.itch.io/ritual-of-the-moon)**) being an obvious touchpoint.

This whole paper is *full* of great quotes specifically thinking about how slowness can bring about reflection. (and their use of reflection is in line with how I would like to think about it, though it is worth noting that they do not define how they are suing reflection)

_"What are the characteristics of in- formation and computing technology that initiate changes towards a more reflective environment? One partial answer to this question is that such technology is slow in nature.
Imagine an electronic doorbell that plays short fragments of a very long melody each time we press the doorbell button. To fully grasp the doorbell through its behaviour, we have to stop and reflect for a moment each time it rings and only over time can we grasp the whole melody. It is technology that claims time."_ (2) #slowness

_"We can compare the two doorbells with, say, the distinction between fast-food such as ready- made hamburgers and a gourmet meal. In both cases it is food to eat, but there is a fundamental difference in appearance. While the readymade hamburger is all about fast, efficient uniformity ‚Äì the mechanisation of eating ‚Äì gourmet cuisine is slow food, in terms of both preparation and eating, which invites us to reflect on the art of cooking as well as the art of eating."_ (2)

_"All design with deep roots in art is concerned with amplifying the presence of things to make them into something more than efficient tools for specific, well-defined tasks "_ (2)

_"Given these objectives design will have to be evaluated by investigating the design, perhaps in a way similar to the methods developed in art critique: cultivating evaluation as the art of explanation and understanding."_ (7)

_"focus on slowness of appearance (materialisation, manifestation) and presence ‚Äì the slow materialisation and design presence of form (F)
. focus on aesthetics of material and use simple basic tools of modern technology ‚Äì the clear and simple design presence of material (M)."_ (8)

Misc:
- Soniture (4) is a great word - "With soniture, we mean the more or less movable things in a room that give the room its sounds"

### Hambleton, E. ‚ÄúGray Areas: Analyzing Navigable Narratives in the Not-So-Uncanny Valley Between Soundwalks, Video Games, and Literary Computer Game,‚Äù 2020): 20‚Äì43.

"Navigable narratives" is a good alternative name for walking simulators, but I wonder if other narrative types are not also navigable. Can you not navigate the narrative in a text adventure? Though I suppose her definition naturally excludes them. You invent the genre name, you get to decide what fits in it (*The Witness* has puzzles so can't be one. Okay?) This is a bit besides the point, though.

More importantly, the crossover with soundwalks is great. A few notes:
- Hambleton's statement that most navigable narratives imitate reality (on p. 23) makes me immediately wonder how we can create ones that don't. And why more people haven't?
- The idea that most composers of soundscapes focus on certain key sounds (p. 24) and the discussion of earcons (26) lays a pretty good foundation of thought on why game sound in general might feel a little thin.
- Likewise, thinking of loops and stinger as "essentially a video game-based way of working Schaferian analysis" is a great description. (33) It really helps to differentiate *that* kind of sonic understanding/creation with what Cardiff does (and with what I would like to do). Schaffer's main goal is to help listener's identify the songs (stingers) they are hearing (highlight the sonic landscape) while Cardiff is doing something different. I'm not sure if that differense lies with the "narrator-guide" technique or the weaving of "imaginative stories, philosophy, and poetry into the larger narrative," but it is a start of a delineation. (37-38)
- Astrid Ensslin's notion of different 'literary computer games' doesn't necessarily fit in with this current line of inquiry, but those additional genre separation's are great -- ludic hypermedia,‚Äù ‚Äúinteractive fiction/drama,‚Äù ‚Äúpoetry games,‚Äù ‚Äúliterary auteur games,‚Äù and ‚Äúquasi-literary games. (34)
- "Soundwalks are fixed in real time while navigable narratives are not" (40) but does this have to be the case? Also, can we not argue that it is possible to pause a soundwalk (I did) just like you can a video game?

### Jaaniste, L. "Approaching the Ambient: Creative Practice and the Ambient Mode of Being," 2007

The best thing about this thesis is the structure of breaking down the entirety into the four sections of: 

- by way of concepts
- by way of example
- by way of making
- by way of experience

His fundamental goal of rethinking how 'ambiance' is discussed and designed around is laudable (and fascinating), but generally unhelpful for what I will be working on at this stage. 

### Jensen, J. "Designing for Profound Experiences," 2014

Again, the use of "profound" is a bit of a red herring here. Profound as in containing meaning and being deeper than the "tangible" and "usage" dimensions that he lists (and I suppose there is something profound in the example of riding a bike and being removed from the task at hand \[a la Csikszentmihalyi]), but not the reflective, profound, transcendence that is possible in great art.

That being said, this is some definite value in Jensen's list of characteristics for a general deeper interaction with our designed elements:

- deemphasize the focus on temporal parameters;
- focus on meaning structures;
- encompass the full scope of the experience;
- encourage qualitative approaches through dialogue;
- enable immersion into lived experiences;
- translate into design with usable, lightweight representations.

In particular, the first three seem useful as lenses for designing reflective game experiences. He only has a very short paragraph on the "deemphasize the focus on temporal parameters" idea \[ _most methods used in service design and experience design (e.g., conceptual models, service blueprinting, experience models, or taxonomies) tend to focus on flow and timed sequences; a profound dimension has less focus on temporal parameters._] but there is something there that feels right and appears to line up with Khaled's idea of "disruption over comfort" and "reflection over immersion."
### Jones, L. ‚ÄúArchitectural Catalysts to Contemplation" from *Transcending Architecture*

Jones' essay turns out to be less applicable than I had originally hoped, but there are still a few interesting things here. While she is focusing (as is the entire collection of which it is a part) on the specifically *religious* side of contemplation, the categorization of modes of sacred spaces into *theatric, sanctuary, and contemplative* is a useful way to think about making these spaces. 

Of sanctuary space she says "the demarcation of a ‚Äúthreshold,‚Äù that is, a boundary, limit, frontier, or picket between, in Eliadean terms, two ‚Äúmodes of being‚Äù‚Äîbetween ‚Äúa profane outside‚Äù and ‚Äúa sacred inside.‚Äù This feels in line with line with traditional game design (i.e Huiznga's) notion of the "magic circle," and supports the idea that these spaces can be used for more than just entertainment. Similarly, the move from passive/sanctuary space to active/contemplative space, where the architecture is helping aid in the act of contemplation, is an even more perfect argument and look into the possibility space.

After reading this article, I would like to do a cursory reading of the collection's third section (RESPONSE FROM ARCHITECTURAL PRACTICE) as it appears to have more practical/application-based content. 

### Koike, R. *The Practice of Not Thinking: A Guide to Mindful Living*

The ‚ÄúThree Kleshas (literally poisons) or disturbing emotions‚Äù are desire, anger, and uncertainty (6)

Q: Is there a way to either:
<ol type="a">
	<li>use this knowledge of the kleshas to help people *avoid* these feelings as they are playing a game, 
thus creating a more reflexive experience, or‚Ä¶</li>
	<li>*harness* the kleshas to take the player out of their normal routine, creating something more meaningful for them</li>
</ol>
This second idea is fairly interesting (but slightly disturbing to posit, obviously) BUT, if a normal ‚Äúgood‚Äù state in game-play is the flow-state, then wouldn‚Äôt we want to take the player out of that state to create a state of reflection? Or, again, can that reflection happen after when they consider the experience they‚Äôve just had? We can also argue, though, that maybe this is what every puzzle does: puts a hard stop on flow and forces the player to confront some new idea and/or reality.

A follow-up question then becomes: *is there a way to create a non-puzzle puzzle-like experience (one that takes the player out of normal flow-state and helps them to have a shift in perception)?*

*"Everything affects everything else and is part of an interconnected whole, like the stars that make up a constellation. Don't discriminate between those stars. Give an equal amount of attention to every one of them, and the world of the sounds around you will become enriched" (38)*

This feels like a good place for a classic puzzly experience and also a key quote to be presented to the player before a sonically reflective interaction.

### Kultima, A. *Game Design Praxiology*, 2018

Very visually well-designed dissertation and something to model my own future writing after. There is less of the academic glut here than in other things I have been reading, but I'm still curious if there are ways to push this out even further. On the other hand, where is the line that would be going too far? Great use of personal images, narrative, and writing to tie all of this together.

Building on Nigel Cross's (2007) breakdown of 'design research,' Kultima splits these into _game design praxiology_ (study of game creation) and _game design research_ (studying games as artefacts). (14) I remain slightly more interested (especially as a designer thinking about my own practice) with Cross's third category, _design epistemology_ (study of designerly ways of knowing). There seems to be a real interesting thoughline here with that idea, Ivar Holm's design values, and Bryan Lawson's concept of "guiding principles."

_"The fourth set, the value of artistic expression, innovation and experimentation reflect design values that target games as a multidimensional medium for artistic exploration."_ (80)

Kultima's adaptation of Holm's design values is quite nice here. Thinking of my own work, this notion of a design value of "artistic expression" feels right, and helps to start answering the question, "what kind of games do you enjoy?" It makes sense that designers have these understanding about what is valuable in games (or any artform, really) and that their intended audience would be those that feel the same way. So, a group of friends who enjoy gruesomely shocking horror appreciate the directors and film studios who also value that. And likewise, those filmgoers who are looking for deeply obtuse narrative will gravitate to those types of film (and declare those films "good").[^1] 

_"Throughout my ethnographic period with game developers, it has been clear that the creators value the final product over the ideas. ‚ÄúIt is not the idea; it is the execution‚Äù_ (103)

Really?

[^1]: Not something that I want to get in to here, but this also calls to mind Brendan Keough's use of Bourdieu's concept of "fields" and the conflict for autonomy.

### Locher, P. et al. "Aesthetic Interaction: A Framework," 2010

A heavily product design leaning understanding of aesthetics, but some good takeaways, including:

- feedforward vs. feedback (73)
- Wensveen's three types of interactive system information (inherent, augmented, functional) (73-74)
- the six roles of a product communicated by its appearance (78)

### Lorelei and the Laser Eyes. Simogo, 2024

Started playing this one after reading Simogo's [design goals](https://simogo.com/work/loreleiandthelasereyes/) of the project as "black and white, and should have a slower tempo, be more contemplative, and perhaps be puzzle based" which feels pretty in line with what I am interested in here.

After finishing, I'd say that it works pretty well along those goals? It's definitely more puzzly than contemplative/reflective, but there are mechanical and aesthetic aspects of it that are noteworthy. The main thing there is the ambiguity. In their game description page they describe taking influence from Paul Auster with a desire to focus on "exploring story concepts of media within media, stories within stories, and the feeling of characters as more floating concepts, which would leave the player guessing who was who, or when the game even took place." This uncertainty of both narrative and spatial conditions breaks the flow in ways to heighten the reflective matter. 

### Meelberg, V. "Sound Design Thinking" from *Doing Research in Sound Design*

*"Because of the specific characteristics of sound \[...\], aspects such as communication, relationality and interaction become perhaps even more important in sound design that (sic) in other design disciplines that work with materials other than sound. **It could even be said that sound design is a practice in which such aspects are constantly reflected upon**" (6)

*"Sound is used as a means to reflect on issues related to interaction, communication, and relationality"* (6)

Nice.

*"Sonic thinking stresses that auditory experience is corporeal. Sound are felt before they are interpreted and quantified by listeners. Consequently, in sound design, considered as a form of sonic thinking, it is more important to focus on what a sound does, or can do, than on what sound is.* (14)

### Miller, J. et al. "A Design Framework for Reflective Play," 2024

The most obvious thing to come out of this is the five 'approaches' for reflective play:

- Disruptions -  specifically *dissonance* and *discomfort*
- Slowdowns - I like the use of "speed bumps" here. Reminds me of this essay: https://intothespine.com/2021/03/27/in-praise-of-negative-space-in-video-game-storytelling/
- Questioning
	- Demanding self-explanation: absurdism, ambiguous instructions/story
	- Hypothesis testing: multiple solutions, multiple tools, explorable spaces, stsystem dynamics / emergent behavior, projective stance
- Revisiting - not sure about the benefit of this one...
- Enhancers

_"we operationalize refection as any cognitive or behavioral reappraisal which supports developing new insights or effecting changes in values or judgment."_ (2.0.1)

_"The kind of refection elicited can be shallow, in-game learning, or deep re-evaluations of ethical and societal world views;"_ (1.0.5)

We have here a definition of 'reflection' similar to how it's being used by others, where a piece of media creates 'change' in the participant. The introduction alone uses phrases like _challenge our foundational belief, reflective or transformational experiences_, and _forming relationships between ideas_. This is in contrast to Djabbara's definition definition of contemplation as "a state of intense concentration, introspection, and open or directed consideration." Obviously, there is a possibility of change from contemplative experiences, but I think the difference here is it is not the stated goal? Specifically, the goal is not *learning*.

That being said, I think that the approaches might also be useful in some part for creating contemplation as well.

Side note: are we doing spoiler alerts in articles now?

[Sabrina's Culyba's _The Transformational Framework_](https://www.transformationalframework.com/) seems like a good reference

### Disasterpeace. ‚ÄúMini Metro,‚Äù n.d.

The menu soundtrack alone makes me want to to give up. This is exactly what I have been talking about! I‚Äôm glad to be playing this after seeing the talk about it because I already am making deeper connections to what is happening here.

In general the sounds are really pleasing. It does such a good job of communicating what happens to you in a very musical way. I don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs easy to discern exactly what it is trying to communicate (expect the ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a new station‚Äù sound which is perfect), but you get that the sounds are tied to something, and I think that‚Äôs enough

### Niedderer, K. "Designing Mindful Interaction: The Category of Performative Object," 2007

Niedderer's definition of "performative object" is really helpful here. This is definitely something that I have been dancing around (even as far back as the inclusion of "design interventions" in curriculum), but having a specific definition for this idea in product design is nice. It's notable that she separates out these performative objects from art objects.

_"For example, the display of a half-full water glass on a shelf would not draw anyone‚Äôs attention if it were in a kitchen. But if the same glass is called ‚ÄúAn Oak Tree‚Äù and/or displayed in the context of an (art) gallery, we allow time to notice the glass and its meaning. Mindfulness therefore can be created through the institutional context of art, which is ‚Äúa certain set of coordinated social practices.‚Äù However, the concern here is with objects that can cause mindfulness in the context of everyday use, and not in the institutional context of art"_ (12)

I suppose it makes sense that objects meant to be used as products should exist in a different category than those for art's sake, but I'm not sure (especially when we think about where interactive artforms like video-games might fit in with that) I need to spend more time mulling that over.

Also helpful is this separation of mindfulness into "mindfulness of mindfulness" and "mindfulness of something else"

_"This shows that mindfulness has two components: one is that of awareness or consciousness per se. The other is that of awareness or attentiveness ‚Äúof something,‚Äù (i.e., the phenomenal content). One is the frame of mind, while the other is its content."_ (8)

That splitting of the "frame" and "content" (or form and function) is discussed at length here, and is especially important when she discusses *how* we can cause these mindful interactions.

_"In this sense, if function implies the preconception of a plan of action and if mindfulness can be caused by a disruption of preconception and the experiences linked to it, then we can conclude that a disruption of function could cause a disruption of this preconception of action and the experi- ences linked to it, and thus cause mindfulness. In other words, I argue that a modification of function in the sense of a disruption- of-function can be used to break through patterns of perception and preconception, and to cause mindfulness"_ (10)

This feels fairly in-line with Khaled's concept of both "disruption over comfort" and "reflection over immersion" and Miller et al's "disruptions."

Finally, I hadn't heard of Brainball (now [Mindball](https://www.mindball.se/)) before, and this feels like a pretty great example of behavior-switching leading to reflection in a game-like context. Though I suppose now the questions is: now that it has become a product on its own and this is the norm, is it sill "subverting expectations?"

### O'Hara, W. "Mapping Sound: Play, Performance, and Analysis in *Proteus*," 2020

O'Hara's analysis of *Proteus* in conversation with mid-twentieth-century musical modernism is pretty much a slam dunk. The idea of thinking through scores graphically (especially in context of video game music) fits really well here. It definitely gets into the weeds a little bit in analyzing the actual musical content, but I appreciated the higher-level suggestions, especially when thinking about it from my own compositional practices. 

Some quotes and ideas that stood out:

_"The player‚Äôs dual orientation makes analysis challenging; as the decisions and desires of the performing self intertwine with, reinforce, and contradict the decisions and desires of the observing self, it becomes difficult to mark off where one ends and the other begins."_ (39) -- This echos Galloway's problem with avatar vs. player. 

_"Audio in Proteus walks a line between two categories of game sound described by Karen Collins: interactive sound, which responds directly to the player‚Äôs input (e.g., the sound of Mario‚Äôs jump in Super Mario Bros.); and adaptive sound, which reflects changing states of the game that are outside the player‚Äôs direct control (e.g., changing soundscapes or soundtrack cues to reflect the passage of day into night in The Legend of Zelda series). Elements of the game‚Äôs environment, such as trees, water, gravestones, and birds, produce sounds in characteristic but unpredictable ways. The island and its environmental features act as a kind of indeterminate notation, depicting general shapes and contours. The nature of the objects sometimes gives a clue as to the sounds that will be produced‚Äîthe mimetic noises made by moving animals, or the deep tones of the dark, imposing gravestones‚Äîbut the relationship between image and sound is just as often hidden (as is the case with the slow synthesizer melodies that seem to accompany trees)."_ (44)

In general, I really appreciated the adaptability and depth of possibilities that the compositional structure afforded, but I wished that the sounds themselves worked more in harmony with each other. I found that *Panoramical* did a much better job of this, and I assume that it's a matter of improving the craft as you work from project to project (though I could be wrong, and the sounds chosen here are more purposeful than I imagine). In a footnote, O'Hara references Ian Bogost's statement that *Proteus* works as a "makeshift ambient sound generator" which feels accurate 

_"Videogames are musical interfaces."_ (45) -- Full stop. Good.

_"In music theoretical terms, the collapse of the performer/listener dichotomy is traumatic: it means the dissolution of the Cartesian subject/object divide that underlies much of Western musical thought."_ (48)

 I don't know if I agree with this. There is something a bit more nuanced, I believe. Instead of thinking about it as a breakdown between performer/listener, I would more often think of it in terms of a composer/performer relationship. Just as a performer can still "feel" the music a composer has written out for them, making slight variations in performative space, so the player can make these micro adjustments to explore the musical space laid out in these digital compositions.  
 
![[proteusWalkingScore.png]]

I'm in love with Kanaga's walking score for Proteus, both as a way to think of the game compositionally, and also obviously with how it relates to the experiences being created/curated by Cardiff/Miller. It feels like a crack of light begins to emerge that shows how to deal with these relationships.

### Pallasmaa, J. "Light, Silence, and Spirituality in Architecture and Art," 2015

(from *Transcending Architecture*)

The language that Pallasmaa uses to describe deep experiences with "secular" objects is the real key to start explaining the type of interactions I am looking to explore. 

_"The spirituality invoked by a secular artistic work is a personal and individual existential experience which obtains its aura and impact through the inherent nature of human experience itself without any explicit religious symbolization, connotation, or designation. Such an experience may arise, for example, from an exceptional atmospheric character of place or space, expressiveness of form, immensity of scale, intense materiality or color, or a transcendent illumination."_ (20)

I would imagine that there is plenty of writing in this vein about the natural world as well, but it is especially helpful here when talking about designed objects, and, most-importantly, **non-art objects.** 

Pallasmaa's use of the "notion of the sublime" is also compelling. (21) He traces it as an essential part of 19th century Romantic art that was reintroduced by the Abstract Expressionists and Minimalists. Enough pedigree for me! Is that a possible label: "sublime games"..? Don't love it. Especially with the obvious LBC band connections... But still. Something there.

_"The marble courtyard of Louis Kahn‚Äôs Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, seen against the horizon line of the Pacific Ocean, turns the sky into the celestial ceiling of this ascetic but metaphysical outdoor space; this authoritative space confronts the individual with the universe and silences her/him to cosmic reflection."_ (22) -- the "reflection" that I mean!

"_Works of art open up channels of feeling, understanding, and empathy that would not be available for us without the authoritative and magical presence of the artistic imagery. These works present us with phenomena of beauty, spirituality, and transcendence that we could not otherwise confront, identify, and grasp. Artistic experience is an act of collaboration, compassion, and sharing that opens us toward the world."_ (23)

_"Whenever we are struck by a profound piece of art, architecture, painting, or music, the work silences us and we find ourselves listening to our own existence."_ (29) -- BOOM!

_"In the middle of today‚Äôs digital, virtual, and instantaneous utopia, we desire to reencounter the fundamental causalities and limits of life."_ (32)

### Sch√∂n, D. *The Reflective Practitioner*, 1982

_"This concept of 'application' leads" to a view of professional knowledge as hierarchy in which 'general principles' occupy the highest level and 'concrete problem solving' the lowest"_ (24)

_"Even the famous 'case method' was originally grounded in the belief that the teaching of scientific principles should precede the development of skills in their application"_ (29)

It's noteworthy that these two statements seem to remain true? Even reflecting on the way that I taught foundational design practice to ATLAS students, it was principles/approaches/ideas first, and the opportunity for application after.

A question (which is not relevant to the project-at-hand, but is worthwhile): Is the Technical Rationality model still relevant/used because there is more computing power to run model simulations and thus is not "increasingly divergent from real-world problems of practice" (44)

_"It is this entire process of reflection-in-action which is central to the 'art' by which practitioners sometimes deal well with situations of uncertainty, instability, uniqueness, and value conflict"_ (50)

Much of the material on 'knowing-in-action' that follows this statement is focusing on how we know things (tacit knowledge) rather than on how we learn and or process. I understand that it is setting up his argument for 'reflecting-in-action' (p. 54), but really I wonder if Sch√∂n's whole argument about reflection is not entirely what I mean when I am using 'reflection.' Clearly it is more about learning-by-doing/reflecting / tacit microchanges in action. The examples of the baseball player adapting to the hitters he faces and the jazz musician who slightly changes the way he plays to fit in with his fellow players both point to this. A "feel" for the music/ball. They are reflecting. They are in flow. But they are not participating in the reflective/contemplative mindset that we sometimes feel when confronted with art. 

The focus here overall seems to be about learning (which I have seen in those who frequently reference Sch√∂n as well), and that feels different from contemplation, but is it? Is a Buddhist monk "learning" when they gain an insight about the world around them? Is a concert-goer learning when they feel moves by a concerto? Or a museum-goer to a piece of art they are experiencing in a new way? Is it better to ignore how these feel disconnected to me and to follow the way that others have come to use and reference Sch√∂n?

### Schoffelen, J. et al. "Making and reflecting via Playful Design Representations," 2013

Initially excited about this from a teaching point-of-view, but I think that their proposals and take-aways miss the mark (especially when you consider the MDM framework as a code-design based solution to this problem that works rather well). Perhaps the age of the essay is playing a part here, but coming from a teaching background, getting students to reflect via design journaling doesn't seem as difficult as it is presented here.

## Medina-Gray, E. "Interacting with Soundscapes: Music, Sound Effects and Dialogue in Video Games," 2021

_"An even broader consideration of gameplay soundscapes would also include sounds produced within a player‚Äôs physical environment,"_ (177) immediately becomes an object of more interest than what the chapter proposes...

## Sengers, P. et al. "Reflective Design," 2005

Is this the paper that moves the definition/focus of "reflection" from an artistic reflection to a more practical one? I know it is heavily cited (789). The use of reflection in the abstract is telling:

- "reflection on unconscious values"
- "reflective design combines analysis of the ways in which technologies reflect and perpetuate unconscious cultural assumptions"
- "devices that reflect alternative possibilities"

From here they go on to specify a systematic approach to "critical reflection" which is definitely more in line with Dewey's notion of reflection:

_"Our perspective on reflection is grounded in critical theory, a Western tradition of critical reflection embodied in various intellectual strands including Marxism, feminism, racial and ethnic studies, media studies and psychoanalysis. (The potential of Eastern reflective traditions such as Buddhism for HCI is beyond the scope of this work..)"_ (2)

_"We define 'reflection' as referring to critical reflection, or bringing unconscious aspects of experience to conscious awareness, thereby making them available for conscious choice. This critical reflection is crucial to both individual freedom and our quality of life in society as a whole, since without it, we unthinkingly adopt attitudes, practices, values, and identities we might not consciously espouse. Additionally, reflection is not a purely cognitive activity, but is folded into all our ways of seeing and experiencing the world."_ (2)

In contrast, their description of **critical design** is probably more in line with the design goals that I have in mind:

_"A critical designer designs objects not to do what users want and value, but to introduce both designers and users to new ways of looking at the world and the role that designed objects can play for them in it."_ (3)

However, their Principles of Reflective Design still seem to hold true for my pursuit: (7)

- Designers should use reflection to uncover and alter the limitations of design practice.
- Designers should use reflection to re-understand their own role in the technology design process.
- Designers should support users in reflecting on their lives.
- Technology should support skepticism about and reinterpretation of its own working.
- Reflection is not a separate activity from action but is folded into it as an integral part of experience
- Dialogic engagement between designers and users through technology can enhance reflection.

Similarly, their strategies for reflective design are good, but overall I find them too presecriptive.

## Shklovsky, V. "Art as Technique," 1917

_"'Art is thinking in images.' These maxims have led to far-fetched interpretations of individual works of art. Attempts have been made to evaluate even music, architecture, and lyric poetry as imagistic thought."_ (1) 

_"Thus a work may be (1) intended as prosaic and accepted as poetic, or (2) intended as poetic and accepted as prosaic. This suggests that the artistry attributed to a given work results from the way we perceive it."_ (1)

_"Habitualization devours work, clothes, furniture, one's wife, and the fear of war. "If the whole complex lives of many people go on unconsciously, then such lives are as if they had never been." And art exists that one may recover the sensation of life; it exists to make one feel things, to make the stone stony. The purpose of art is to impart the sensation of things as they are perceived and not as they are known. The technique of art is to make objects "unfamiliar," to make forms difficult, to increase the difficulty and length of perception because the process of perception is an aesthetic end in itself and must be prolonged"_ (2) #gestalt

This goes along with the idea of difficulty/conflict/gestalt when thinking of reflective/contemplative design.

Shklovsky's use of Tolstoy's writing from a horse's perspective reminds me of Chekhov's *Grisha*: "Nurse and mamma are comprehensible: they dress Grisha, feed him, and put him to bed, but what papa exists for is unknown."

_"A work is created "artistically" so that its perception is impeded and the greatest possible effect is produced through the slowness of the perception"_ (6)

## Stockburger, A. "Listen to the Bulk of the Iceberg: On the Impact of Sound in Digital Games," 2007

Much shorter than expected! But a couple of good (if slightly hyperbolic\[?]) quotes:

_"it is truly sound that holds the key to fully accessing 3D representational spaces simply because the human perception system presupposes this"_ (111)

_"\[T]he ‚Äòpong‚Äô sound of the collision detection seems like a reward for the right answer in a responsible game, and its steady recurrence makes audible the functioning of this ball game and thus couples man and game to the beat of a shared internal clock."_ (112) -- Claus Pias

## Stone, K. "Ritual of the Moon," 2019

Day 1: I'm liking these even more the second time through. There are so many compelling ideas that I would love to incorporate into future work, namely: 

- A game that only asks 5 minutes a day from you, over time - could you do the same thing but with no daily commitment? I wonder how much the routine of the thing makes the experience.
- The general slowness feels nice
- The textures and visual design are pretty great. I don't think I had paid that much attention to the depth of imagery last time, and I really love how all of the textures work in conflict
- The music is quite good. I can definitely see myself doing something in this vein, though I would like to see more variety
- The typography feels so labor-intensive. It kind of stresses me out

Day 2: On the second day I feel like I've already hit a routine. Click this, move here, click that, move the comet. It *is* my second time through, but I wonder if more variety would have been better? To that point, Kara Stone's [pre-release blog post](https://karastone.itch.io/ritual-of-the-moon/devlog/77091/pre-release-feelings-emptiness) is noteworthy. Additionally, I listened to the [soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/album/1O8yDthfsXGjzmYyW9XzU9?si=Bhdx5ofdQdaNZxRgNcKgUA) last night and was surprised to find that it didn't work as well in that format as it does in-game. Lastly, I wonder why she made the decision that the stars need to be drawn in an unbroken line to move the interaction forward. Is there something deeper there or just a functional decision?

Day 4: I accidentally skipped a day! I actually feel a little guilty. "Doing nothing is a good as doing it myself" helps to bring the negative vibes. I wonder what a version of this that encourages people to interact with the thing on a daily basis but isn't rooted in such a positive/negative outcome might look like. How could you use a carrot rather than a stick? What kind of external reminder system could you set up? (i.e outside of the game-world)

## Sun, P. et al, ‚ÄúResearch-Creation as a Generative Approach to Sound Design,‚Äù 2021

A good description of what these projects are, but not really any significant writing on how this changes what we can think about in regards to "generative" approaches to research-creation. A bit misleading.

Do I need a [Shure MV88](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/mv88?variant=MV88%252FA) microphone? Probably not. But I want one...

## Thompson, I. "The Soundscape Approach: New Opportunities in Sound Design Practice," 2022

Overall a nice and fascinating look at a more holistic type of soundscape analysis, but probably a little less relevant to the things I'm thinking about. *However* there are a ton of useful tidbits/references in here, including:

- "Soundscaping" as a term for the practice of sound design seems useful.
