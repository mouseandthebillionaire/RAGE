A collection of quotes, reflections, design ideas, musings, et cetera pertaining to the readings completed in preparation for comprehensive exams. (Starting June 4, 2024)

### Austin, M. "Music Games," 2021

Not a *ton* here, but I particularly enjoyed the background on some music-games that I was not aware of or had forgotten about, including:
- [Quest for Fame (1995)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uka9EQLqlDc)
- [Dance Aerobics (1987)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ6V3D5kpsQ)
- [Musika (2007)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musika)
- [DropMix (2017)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DropMix)

Austin's classification of music games as either procedural/conceptual is very interesting, but less pertinent to this current project. There are a couple of additional essays from this collection (*The Cambridge Companion to Video Game Music*) that I may add to the list as they seem more useful, but I will wait until I actually read to make sure they are a good fit. These are Richard Stevens' "The Inherent Conflicts of Musical Interactivity in Video Games," and Elizabeth Medina-Gray's "Interacting with Soundscapes: Music, Sound Effects and Dialogue in Video Games" And dare I even *suggest* Dana Plank's "Audio and the Experience of Gaming: A Cognitive-Emotional Approach to Video Game Sound"..?

### Bermudez, J. Introduction to *Transcending Architecture*, 2015

Some really nice thoughts in here. Bermudez's definition of architecture that "transcends" feels particularly helpful: 
	"They are talking of an architecture that has removed the 'opacity' hiding life’s meanings so that we can catch a momentous and revelatory (even if unsettling) glimpse"

This feels more aligned with what I think of as reflection than I have found before. An artistic reflection vs. an educational one. A reflection that includes a stepping back but not necessarily a re-evaluation or change in preconceived ideas. Bermudez goes on to add:
	"We should also notice that these qualifiers are referring to something “other than” or “beyond” architecture. It is as if the experience of the building has exceeded the building, passing, as it were, through it into another realm that defies all words or gauging."

It is this passing on or beyond that I believe games can do well (as perhaps all great art does?) The subject material and the activity goes beyond narrative topics and the mechanics of play into something deeper. Beyond.

### Bogost, I. "Relaxation" from *How to Do Things with Videogames,*  2011

Bogost has some interesting excursions into and around reflection in his essay on “Relaxation” in games. And there are definitely some parallels here, but it strikes me that the notion of “relaxing” and/or “zen” games remains in a different category than “reflective” games. The goal of a relaxing game is obviously to relax, and zen games are (per Bogost) “akin to doodling on a napkin or skimming through a magazine, or knitting in front of the television” (92) These really are the lean-back forms of games that Bogost is arguing towards here, where the mind becomes calmer through the activity. But in true “reflective” media is there this calmness? Are we “calm” when brought face to face with notions that challenge the way we have constructed the world around us?

Bogost’s mention of “meditation” and walking is a surprising turn that is obviously an interesting one for future work and writing. Baudelaire, Thoreau, obviously, but he also mentions medieval labyrinths, which are a great example of the kind of reflective activity I’m thinking of. Labyrinths are definitely (or can be) akin to the idea of knitting in front of the television. Activities to be doing while your mind is focused on something else. Is there something to be said for the busy-work of games freeing your mind to go elsewhere? Is this something that can be explored, but just hasn’t been talked about that much? Or is it a tenuous link?

Finally, this quote in his conclusion is pertinent 
	“Relaxation and reflection arise from constrained environments in which the senses are de-emphasized and focused rather than escalated and expanded.” (95)

Is this true? Relaxation, maybe? But reflection? Are we reflecting if our senses have become de-emphasized? Focused, feels right, though. We do want our senses focused and honed in order to see things in a new way. Again, more work to be done by thinking about reflective architecture, and how that can be applied to games.
### Fullerton, T. "Slow Play" from *The Infinite Playground*, De Koven, B. 2020

"'Slow play' \[...] allows for, and even depends on, an internal and emotional process on the part of the player. This is play that nurtures that internal process through its design. its scope, and its pace."

"the process of making meaning through reflection requires time at a human pace and cycles of response, interpretation, and unpacking of experience."

It’s interesting to think about the place that time has in the success of possibility for reflective play. It does seem that for reflection to happen there also needs to be the time to reflect. But does that time necessarily have to happen with the timeframe of the game? Once we are outside of the magic circle, could we not continue to think about the experience that we just had and reflect on it? Additionally there is some space in longer experiences to build in these moments of reflection (what De Koven calls “interludes”) to provide a momentary reflection-time for the audience. The best theatre/cinema does this by necessity because a viewer cannot stop the action on the stage/screen.

This, then, opens up some interesting possibilities: an arcade game experience could be reflective if its content/nature/gameplay/(something else?) contained deep and thoughtful ideas. The player may feel like they are doing something frantic and mindless, but the moment thet stop, could reflection happen? Prior personal work like [_Busy Work_](http://www.mouseandthebillionaire.com/busyWork/) and [_Buy! Sell!_](http://www.mouseandthebillionaire.com/buySell) have perhaps tested this theory to varying degrees of success… It could be worthwhile to spend some time spent thinking about what this material "something" is that makes a piece of media appropriate for reflection.

### Flusser, V. *The Shape of Things*, 1999

_"This new human being in the process of being born all around us and within us is in fact without hands. He does not handle things anymore, so in his case one cannot speak of actions anymore. Nor of practice, nor of work for that matter. The only things left of his hands are the tips of his fingers, which he uses to tap on keys so as to play with symbols. The new human being is not a man of action anymore but a player: homo ludens as opposed to homo faber."_ (91)

So much prescience in Flusser's essays, but this feels exceptionally so. Additionally the following line that "life is not a drama for him, but a performance." Really, this whole paragraph should go in here, but trying to focus in on a smaller portion. But yes, especially in my own work, performance is a key aspect. Creating performative opportunities for unnexpected joy. Experiences that are just as fun to watch as they are to play. A positive spin on the darker aspects that Flusser is highlighting. And there are a number of examples of this within the world of games/play, but the few that come to mind most readily are *JS Joust, DDR, [Disunion](https://vimeo.com/65510054)*. Does organized sport fit in here as well? We could argue that in sport performance is *far* more important than fun.

### Gibbons, Liam. “Strategies for the Design of Reflective Shortform Videogames,” 2020

Gibbons strategies for making games reflective are as follows (with accompanying pull-quotes and notes):

1. *Limit, omit, and make ambiguous formal ludic components such as explicit objectives and win/lose conditions.*

	- "by removing a formal ludic component from a game design, it becomes ambiguous, and player-defined" - This makes me think of the Sims, and I'm not convinced that by making objectives player-defined we necessarily make it reflective. Case in point, my forever example of player-defined objectives is "don't step on a crack" which I can't imagine that any child has ever reflected deeply on what that says about their relationship with their mother.
	- Note: Gibbons then immediately quotes Costikyan as describing Sim City as a "software toy"
	- Okay, I buy this: "In the absence of such a pre-determined objective then, the actions and gestures of the player are no longer inherently desirable or damaging, as they do not move the player closer to victory or failure. As such, the player may decide the value of their actions, and the outcomes that they generate, for themselves." By framing the interaction as "ambiguous" we immediately acknowledge that the player is the one assigning meaning to any decisions.
	- This also aligns with my desire to make games that have neither good nor bad choices. Is it that the ambiguity of choice is inherently reflective? If the choice is obviously good/bad then there is no need to reflect on it? If a player is asked to remove a stone from play and that removal is obviously the right choice, they will probably just do it, yes? But if the stone is an animal and the removal is death? A harder choice? I'm not sure...

1. *Explicate but do not quantify spatiotemporal barriers.*
	- "To specifically elicit reflective play however, I found it useful to avoid quantifying my spatiotemporal barriers, boundaries, and limits. This is because a quantified spatiotemporal barrier shifts the character of the play that occurs within it towards competition, and away from reflection" - Common sense, a bit. Time limits, at least, guarantee for a focus on "winning." There is also an idea here about reflection being "outside of time." We can best and truly reflect only when we are not mindful of time's pressure.
	- Gibbons goes on to comment on the time limit imposed by Anna Anthropy in *Queers in love at the end of the world,* mentioning that the reflection can only happen at the *end* of the game. But this seems a valid use of time-restraint to cause reflection, yes? Similarly, can a silly arcade experience (Busy Work, Buy! Sell!) also create reflection? Are there ways to make the *aftermath* of a game experience more reflective?
	- It is worth noting that barriers aren't nearly as problematic in Gibbons' game [*Dream*](https://liamgibbonsphd.itch.io/dream) as the obvious presence of *goals.* I see a key and a door that is clearly locked, and so instead of reflecting I am immediately compelled to complete the task.

3. *Contain the various elements and dynamics of the game design within a single spatial cell.*

4. *Avoid interrupting or overtly directing the player’s engagement with the game system*

*“To understand how we might encourage reflective play within a short form therefore, we first need to understand how we can make room for that reflection and anticipation to occur during the player’s direct experience of a game, rather than after it.”*

I suppose that I can understand why Gibbons is looking specifically at how to create reflective experiences _during_ play, but I wonder if there is a real need? Perhaps his desire to make shortform games necessitates this a bit more, but doesn't the pause menu actually provide a perfect place for reflection to happen? Just as paragraph/section/chapter breaks allow the reader a natural place to stop the act of reading to filter it through their own experiences. Especially if chess is used as an example. With chess being such a rich space for theory, reflection, stories, etc, isn’t okay to reflect “during the pause menu” as it were? Or maybe when we reflect during a game of chess, we aren’t necessarily “pausing” the game? We are still within the game-space? Maybe then the question/practice/idea is to create a pause-state like functionality that doesn’t _feel_ like a pause-state. If you simply stop feeding input into the system it stays in a state of stasis without feeling removed from the game. It’s the difference between sitting with a furrowed brow and pondering your next move in chess and pushing back your chair, standing up, and walking away from the chess board. And maybe this is the better way of talking about this idea. A fluid pause-state that doesn’t take you out of the game, but still allows for this period of reflection.

It is also worth noting that I think my definition of reflection differs from Gibbons’.

*“reflection-based play activities make no immediate demands of the player, as I will discuss in more detail throughout this chapter. These activities allow or even require the player to think back and reflect upon past events and instances of reaction-based play, think forward and anticipate future events, and to consider and experiment with potential courses of action”*

While I don’t deny that these activities are “reflective” (in that the player is reflecting on the state of play) I find it slightly removed from reflection in the depper context that I am considering. I want to make some wider gulf between deep reflection and simply “thinking back on past play sessions and what might come next.” Gibbons’ use of reflection reminds me more of Bogost’s discussion of “lean back” media in “How to do Things with Videogames.”

### Jensen, J. "Designing for Profound Experiences," 2014

Again, the use of "profound" is a bit of a red herring here. Profound as in containing meaning and being deeper than the "tangible" and "usage" dimensions that he lists (and I suppose there is something profound in the example of riding a bike and being removed from the task at hand \[a la Csikszentmihalyi]), but not the reflective, profound, transcendence that is possible in great art.

That being said, this is some definite value in Jensen's list of characteristics for a general deeper interaction with our designed elements:

- deemphasize the focus on temporal parameters;
- focus on meaning structures;
- encompass the full scope of the experience;
- encourage qualitative approaches through dialogue;
- enable immersion into lived experiences;
- translate into design with usable, lightweight representations.

In particular, the first three seem useful as lenses for designing reflective game experiences. He only has a very short paragraph on the "deemphasize the focus on temporal parameters" idea \[ _most methods used in service design and experience design (e.g., conceptual models, service blueprinting, experience models, or taxonomies) tend to focus on flow and timed sequences; a profound dimension has less focus on temporal parameters._] but there is something there that feels right and appears to line up with Khaled's idea of "disruption over comfort" and "reflection over immersion."
### Jones, L. “Architectural Catalysts to Contemplation" from *Transcending Architecture*

Jones' essay turns out to be less applicable than I had originally hoped, but there are still a few interesting things here. While she is focusing (as is the entire collection of which it is a part) on the specifically *religious* side of contemplation, the categorization of modes of sacred spaces into *theatric, sanctuary, and contemplative* is a useful way to think about making these spaces. 

Of sanctuary space she says "the demarcation of a “threshold,” that is, a boundary, limit, frontier, or picket between, in Eliadean terms, two “modes of being”—between “a profane outside” and “a sacred inside.” This feels in line with line with traditional game design (i.e Huiznga's) notion of the "magic circle," and supports the idea that these spaces can be used for more than just entertainment. Similarly, the move from passive/sanctuary space to active/contemplative space, where the architecture is helping aid in the act of contemplation, is an even more perfect argument and look into the possibility space.

After reading this article, I would like to do a cursory reading of the collection's third section (RESPONSE FROM ARCHITECTURAL PRACTICE) as it appears to have more practical/application-based content. 

### Koike, R. *The Practice of Not Thinking: A Guide to Mindful Living*

The “Three Kleshas (literally poisons) or disturbing emotions” are desire, anger, and uncertainty (6)

Q: Is there a way to either:
<ol type="a">
	<li>use this knowledge of the kleshas to help people *avoid* these feelings as they are playing a game, 
thus creating a more reflexive experience, or…</li>
	<li>*harness* the kleshas to take the player out of their normal routine, creating something more meaningful for them</li>
</ol>
This second idea is fairly interesting (but slightly disturbing to posit, obviously) BUT, if a normal “good” state in game-play is the flow-state, then wouldn’t we want to take the player out of that state to create a state of reflection? Or, again, can that reflection happen after when they consider the experience they’ve just had? We can also argue, though, that maybe this is what every puzzle does: puts a hard stop on flow and forces the player to confront some new idea and/or reality.

A follow-up question then becomes: *is there a way to create a non-puzzle puzzle-like experience (one that takes the player out of normal flow-state and helps them to have a shift in perception)?*

*"Everything affects everything else and is part of an interconnected whole, like the stars that make up a constellation. Don't discriminate between those stars. Give an equal amount of attention to every one of them, and the world of the sounds around you will become enriched" (38)*

This feels like a good place for a classic puzzly experience and also a key quote to be presented to the player before a sonically reflective interaction.

### Kultima, A. *Game Design Praxiology*, 2018

Very visually well-designed dissertation and something to model my own future writing after. There is less of the academic glut here than in other things I have been reading, but I'm still curious if there are ways to push this out even further. On the other hand, where is the line that would be going too far? Great use of personal images, narrative, and writing to tie all of this together.

Building on Nigel Cross's (2007) breakdown of 'design research,' Kultima splits these into _game design praxiology_ (study of game creation) and _game design research_ (studying games as artefacts). (14) I remain slightly more interested (especially as a designer thinking about my own practice) with Cross's third category, _design epistemology_ (study of designerly ways of knowing). There seems to be a real interesting thoughline here with that idea, Ivar Holm's design values, and Bryan Lawson's concept of "guiding principles."

_"The fourth set, the value of artistic expression, innovation and experimentation reflect design values that target games as a multidimensional medium for artistic exploration."_ (80)

Kultima's adaptation of Holm's design values is quite nice here. Thinking of my own work, this notion of a design value of "artistic expression" feels right, and helps to start answering the question, "what kind of games do you enjoy?" It makes sense that designers have these understanding about what is valuable in games (or any artform, really) and that their intended audience would be those that feel the same way. So, a group of friends who enjoy gruesomely shocking horror appreciate the directors and film studios who also value that. And likewise, those filmgoers who are looking for deeply obtuse narrative will gravitate to those types of film (and declare those films "good").[^1] 

_"Throughout my ethnographic period with game developers, it has been clear that the creators value the final product over the ideas. “It is not the idea; it is the execution”_ (103)

Really?

[^1]: Not something that I want to get in to here, but this also calls to mind Brendan Keough's use of Bourdieu's concept of "fields" and the conflict for autonomy.

### Lorelei and the Laser Eyes. Simogo, 2024

Started playing this one after reading Simogo's [design goals](https://simogo.com/work/loreleiandthelasereyes/) of the project as "black and white, and should have a slower tempo, be more contemplative, and perhaps be puzzle based" which feels pretty in line with what I am interested in here.

After finishing, I'd say that it works pretty well along those goals? It's definitely more puzzly than contemplative/reflective, but there are mechanical and aesthetic aspects of it that are noteworthy. The main thing there is the ambiguity. In their game description page they describe taking influence from Paul Auster with a desire to focus on "exploring story concepts of media within media, stories within stories, and the feeling of characters as more floating concepts, which would leave the player guessing who was who, or when the game even took place." This uncertainty of both narrative and spatial conditions breaks the flow in ways to heighten the reflective matter. 

### Meelberg, V. "Sound Design Thinking" from *Doing Research in Sound Design*

*"Because of the specific characteristics of sound \[...\], aspects such as communication, relationality and interaction become perhaps even more important in sound design that (sic) in other design disciplines that work with materials other than sound. **It could even be said that sound design is a practice in which such aspects are constantly reflected upon**" (6)

*"Sound is used as a means to reflect on issues related to interaction, communication, and relationality"* (6)

Nice.

*"Sonic thinking stresses that auditory experience is corporeal. Sound are felt before they are interpreted and quantified by listeners. Consequently, in sound design, considered as a form of sonic thinking, it is more important to focus on what a sound does, or can do, than on what sound is.* (14)

### Niedderer, K. "Designing Mindful Interaction: The Category of Performative Object," 2007

Niedderer's definition of "performative object" is really helpful here. This is definitely something that I have been dancing around (even as far back as the inclusion of "design interventions" in curriculum), but having a specific definition for this idea in product design is nice. It's notable that she separates out these performative objects from art objects.

_"For example, the display of a half-full water glass on a shelf would not draw anyone’s attention if it were in a kitchen. But if the same glass is called “An Oak Tree” and/or displayed in the context of an (art) gallery, we allow time to notice the glass and its meaning. Mindfulness therefore can be created through the institutional context of art, which is “a certain set of coordinated social practices.” However, the concern here is with objects that can cause mindfulness in the context of everyday use, and not in the institutional context of art"_ (12)

I suppose it makes sense that objects meant to be used as products should exist in a different category than those for art's sake, but I'm not sure (especially when we think about where interactive artforms like video-games might fit in with that) I need to spend more time mulling that over.

Also helpful is this separation of mindfulness into "mindfulness of mindfulness" and "mindfulness of something else"

_"This shows that mindfulness has two components: one is that of awareness or consciousness per se. The other is that of awareness or attentiveness “of something,” (i.e., the phenomenal content). One is the frame of mind, while the other is its content."_ (8)

That splitting of the "frame" and "content" (or form and function) is discussed at length here, and is especially important when she discusses *how* we can cause these mindful interactions.

_"In this sense, if function implies the preconception of a plan of action and if mindfulness can be caused by a disruption of preconception and the experiences linked to it, then we can conclude that a disruption of function could cause a disruption of this preconception of action and the experi- ences linked to it, and thus cause mindfulness. In other words, I argue that a modification of function in the sense of a disruption- of-function can be used to break through patterns of perception and preconception, and to cause mindfulness"_ (10)

This feels fairly in-line with Khaled's concept of both "disruption over comfort" and "reflection over immersion" and Miller et al's "disruptions."

Finally, I hadn't heard of Brainball (now [Mindball](https://www.mindball.se/)) before, and this feels like a pretty great example of behavior-switching leading to reflection in a game-like context. Though I suppose now the questions is: now that it has become a product on its own and this is the norm, is it sill "subverting expectations?"

### Sun, P. et al, “Research-Creation as a Generative Approach to Sound Design,” 2021

A good description of what these projects are, but not really any significant writing on how this changes what we can think about in regards to "generative" approaches to research-creation. A bit misleading.

Do I need a [Shure MV88](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/mv88?variant=MV88%252FA) microphone? Probably not. But I want one...

### Thompson, I. "The Soundscape Approach: New Opportunities in Sound Design Practice," 2022

Overall a nice and fascinating look at a more holistic type of soundscape analysis, but probably a little less relevant to the things I'm thinking about. *However* there are a ton of useful tidbits/references in here, including:

- "Soundscaping" as a term for the practice of sound design seems useful.
